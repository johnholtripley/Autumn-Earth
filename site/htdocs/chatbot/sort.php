__question__:not too bad thanks - did you?
__AI__:yeah me too!
__question__:morning ramon, have you got some time free today?
__AI__:yeah of course. I don't have anything at the moment
__question__:We need to change the image size on Redband please
__AI__:no probs
__question__:it's on 60a and they've uploaded a load of images, so can you change the size and then re-create the product thumbs?
__AI__:only recreate thumbs?
__question__:the one that's used in dynamic item frag
__AI__:ok I will start right now
__question__:thanks mate
__AI__:could you check if it's ok?
__question__:that looks good thanks - i'll let the client know
__AI__:by the way let me know if you have something else.
__question__:did the client ask you to create eplay.co.uk?
__AI__:yes!
__question__:is it done?
__AI__:yes, but, database is not yet in SVN
__question__:i don't suppose the client mentioned the enormous amount of development that's needed for this did he?
__AI__:I didn't add because I will have to do some updates but the client hasn't reply yet my email
__question__:oh it is. but if they're having what we talked about in the meeting, there's *a lot* of new work
__AI__:mmm... the client send me a list but there wasn't anything new I don't know if it's the same list
__question__:he's just doing you an email now
__AI__:cool!
__question__:i'll check it through as well and see if it's got everything
__AI__:ok thanks!
__question__:...but i'll start styling what i can now
__AI__:ok, let me create database for you
__question__:thanks
__AI__:ok john it's done
__question__:is eplay uploaded to a server anywhere?
__AI__:morning - not yet - why?
__question__:i was giong to upload styles, but no rush
__AI__:anyway I will upload this afteroon
__question__:cool - grab the latest SVN then and we'll get a rough styled version then
__AI__:ok
__question__:eplay.co.uk/trunk/sitemap shows an XML sitemap, and not the html page - is this right?
__AI__:no idea!:S I just clone from wearepets - let me check
__question__:while you're on eplay, they need breadcrumbs on every page = can you sort that out please (I've added the fragment in, but i guess the class needs altering slightly?)
__AI__:do you need this now?
__question__:whenever you've got time
__AI__:ok I will add later
__question__:they're coming in tomorrow at 9:00. so could you upload everything that is complete and let the client know what is done and not done please?
__AI__:hopefully this store category feature will be finished today
__question__:is there a test account on linux1 for eplay? ramon and 123456 doesn't seem to be working
__AI__:no, you will have to create a new one
__question__:my stuff's in svn now, and let me know when i can carry on then
__AI__:ok thanks and sorry!
__question__:we will need products on homepage but in a specific way - have you seen the concept?
__AI__:well you sent me an image
__question__:i tink i set Genre = brand and Format = Categories - but whichever is easiest for you
__AI__:yeah that's fine
__question__:so the products are the 6 panels at the top under the Assassin#s creed advert
__AI__:yeah
__question__:actually, could they choose the top 5 using the 'feature on home page' checkbox in the backoffice?
__AI__:ok I will do that the user chose in the backoffice
__question__:which might be because it's a big content managed area - let me check with the client
__AI__:I will try to do this homepage for the stores first
__question__:right - just spoken to the client, and the Eplay homepage is just going to be 1 big content managed area
__AI__:ok
__question__:We'll have a header and footer, but then just big WYSIWYG area
__AI__:then it's done you just need to style and that's it
__question__:so what i've started working on in SVN as 'index' is actually a Store homepage
__AI__:that's why I said that it will need some change
__question__:right, i'm off - speak tomorrow!
__AI__:see you tomorrow mate
__question__:morning - what's the ftp password for eplay please?
__AI__:FTP host: 94.236.126.16 user: eplay pass: ????????
__question__:just quickly - how long would it take to change the Category image size for REdband? and to re-create all of the category images at the new size? is it more than 10 minutes?
__AI__:yeah it will be 10 minuts more or less
__question__:would you be able to do that now for me? they're wanting to get this done - UNLESS it stops anything being ready for eplay that they could see in the next half an hour
__AI__:I can do now
__question__:the category images are at the moment 305 x 138, can they be 305 x 184
__AI__:it's done
__question__:thanks mate
__AI__:you are welcome
__question__:after every 3 divs, add a div with a class to clear
__AI__:ok
__question__:thanks
__AI__:you are welcome
__question__:how much have you done?
__AI__:well... I have to do 3-4 things that the client told me
__question__:yeah - that's fine
__AI__:cool!thanks
__question__:were you asked to add in a field for each product?
__AI__:sorry but I think that finallly you told someone else to do it
__question__:oh, no, that was something else. can you add a new TinyCME area for each product called 'supported products'? and then display it on the product details page
__AI__:ok. I will do it now but nobody told me anything about that
__AI__:ok. I will have to retrieve database and files as I hven't worked with this project yet
__question__:oh, and add a pdf upload for each product
__AI__: and show the link in the frontend if there's a file?
__question__:...that's much simpler isn't it?
__AI__:well....yeah it's simple
__question__:didn't you do something like this for NYA?
__AI__:yes a no!:P
__question__:the new pages that i list should be Editable pages, but they need to be able to add their own new pages and these should be Dynamic pages
__AI__:and where should I show the information? at the top where the products are listed?
__question__:is this front end or backoffice? the dynamic pages should work exactly like the editable (if that's what you mean?) 
__AI__:but for example about us should be in dynamic or static?
__question__:could you upload your changes please?
__AI__:ok I will have to upload full website as I can't remember all the files
__question__:shall i check if they've added products?
__AI__:I checked backoffice and they haven't added products
__question__:oh, it didn't work when i just tried
__AI__:I will check
__question__:right - just one more thing
__AI__:ok, tell me
__question__:can you remove that just from these 3 pages please?
__AI__:ok. and you will add the link ../catalogue/service into each page?
__question__:ok - thanks
__AI__:let me know if you need anything else
__question__:is that easy?
__AI__:don't know....
__question__:if it's hard, leave them off, and we'll wait for their feedback
__AI__:ok then better wait
__question__:they should be allowed to create new root dynamic pages shouldn't they?
__AI__:ok I can give access again
__question__:are we doing countdowns or charts?
__AI__:sorry what are countdowns?
__question__:countdown until a game is released
__AI__:sorry no idea what's that
__question__:jeez - you ok?
__AI__:yeah, I'm fine thanks
__question__:oh, while you're working, can you add the 'show on eplay homepage' radio button back into each product
__AI__:I take the radio button off from the backoffice
__question__:if you can add it in to show heroshot like wearepets and i'll style it into the new carousel thing
__AI__:ok no probs I will do it
__question__:can the hero shot be cropped to 835 x 285 px please?
__AI__:ok
__question__:if we can do the obvious stuff like that then it looks like we've done lots!
__AI__:yes.... but then they think that everything is done but no!
__question__:no - we need to make sure they know!
__AI__:so it's good but not reallyt good!:P
__question__:just pick one at random if they have selected more than 1
__AI__:what about if one store doesn't have any product selected?
__question__:awesome mate - thanks
__AI__:is that ok then?
__question__:yeah - looks good
__AI__:ok!good!";
