Whan that Aprille with his shoures sote
The droghte of Marche hath perced to the rote,
And bathed every veyne in swich licour,
Of which vertu engendred is the flour;
Whan Zephirus eek with his swete breeth                        
Inspired hath in every holt and heeth
The tendre croppes, and the yonge sonne
Hath in the Ram his halfe cours y-ronne,
And smale fowles maken melodye,
That slepen al the night with open yë,                        
(So priketh hem nature in hir corages):
Than longen folk to goon on pilgrimages
(And palmers for to seken straunge strondes)
To ferne halwes, couthe in sondry londes;
And specially, from every shires ende                         
Of Engelond, to Caunterbury they wende,
The holy blisful martir for to seke,
That hem hath holpen, whan that they were seke.
Bifel that, in that seson on a day,
In Southwerk at the Tabard as I lay                           
Redy to wenden on my pilgrimage
To Caunterbury with ful devout corage,
At night was come in-to that hostelrye
Wel nyne and twenty in a companye,
Of sondry folk, by aventure y-falle                           
In felawshipe, and pilgrims were they alle,
That toward Caunterbury wolden ryde;
The chambres and the stables weren wyde,
And wel we weren esed atte beste.
And shortly, whan the sonne was to reste,                     
So hadde I spoken with hem everichon,
That I was of hir felawshipe anon,
And made forward erly for to ryse,
To take our wey, ther as I yow devyse.
But natheles, whyl I have tyme and space,                   
Er that I ferther in this tale pace,
Me thinketh it acordaunt to resoun,
To telle yow al the condicioun
Of ech of hem, so as it semed me,
And whiche they weren, and of what degree;
And eek in what array that they were inne:
And at a knight than wol I first biginne.
A Knight ther was, and that a worthy man,             
That fro the tyme that he first bigan
To ryden out, he loved chivalrye,                             
Trouthe and honour, fredom and curteisye.
Ful worthy was he in his lordes werre,
And therto hadde he riden (no man ferre)
As wel in Cristendom as hethenesse,
And ever honoured for his worthinesse.                        
At Alisaundre he was, whan it was wonne;
Ful ofte tyme he hadde the bord bigonne
Aboven alle naciouns in Pruce.
In Lettow hadde he reysed and in Ruce,
No Cristen man so ofte of his degree.                         
In Gernade at the sege eek hadde he be
Of Algezir, and riden in Belmarye.
At Lyeys was he, and at Satalye,
Whan they were wonne; and in the Grete See
At many a noble aryve hadde he be.                            
At mortal batailles hadde he been fiftene,
And foughten for our feith at Tramissene
In listes thryes, and ay slayn his foo.
This ilke worthy knight had been also
Somtyme with the lord of Palatye,                             
Ageyn another hethen in Turkye:
And evermore he hadde a sovereyn prys.
And though that he were worthy, he was wys,
And of his port as meke as is a mayde.
He never yet no vileinye ne sayde                             
In al his lyf, un-to no maner wight.
He was a verray parfit gentil knight.
But for to tellen yow of his array,
His hors were gode, but he was nat gay.
Of fustian he wered a gipoun                                  
Al bismotered with his habergeoun;
For he was late y-come from his viage,
And wente for to doon his pilgrimage.
With him ther was his sone, a yong Squyer,             
A lovyere, and a lusty bacheler,                              
With lokkes crulle, as they were leyd in presse.
Of twenty yeer of age he was, I gesse.
Of his stature he was of evene lengthe,
And wonderly deliver, and greet of strengthe.
And he had been somtyme in chivachye,                         
In Flaundres, in Artoys, and Picardye,
And born him wel, as of so litel space,
In hope to stonden in his lady grace.
Embrouded was he, as it were a mede
Al ful of fresshe floures, whyte and rede.                    
Singinge he was, or floytinge, al the day;
He was as fresh as is the month of May.
Short was his goune, with sleves longe and wyde.
Wel coude he sitte on hors, and faire ryde.
He coude songes make and wel endyte,                          
Iuste and eek daunce, and wel purtreye and wryte,
So hote he lovede, that by nightertale
He sleep namore than dooth a nightingale.
Curteys he was, lowly, and servisable,
And carf biforn his fader at the table.                      
A Yeman hadde he, and servaunts namo                   
At that tyme, for him liste ryde so;
And he was clad in cote and hood of grene;
A sheef of pecok-arwes brighte and kene
Under his belt he bar ful thriftily;                         
(Wel coude he dresse his takel yemanly:
His arwes drouped noght with fetheres lowe),
And in his hand he bar a mighty bowe.
A not-heed hadde he, with a broun visage.
Of wode-craft wel coude he al the usage.                     
Upon his arm he bar a gay bracer,
And by his syde a swerd and a bokeler,
And on that other syde a gay daggere,
Harneised wel, and sharp as point of spere;
A Cristofre on his brest of silver shene.                    
An horn he bar, the bawdrik was of grene;
A forster was he, soothly, as I gesse.
Ther was also a Nonne, a Prioresse,                 
That of hir smyling was ful simple and coy;
Hir gretteste ooth was but by sëynt Loy;                     
And she was cleped madame Eglentyne.
Ful wel she song the service divyne,
Entuned in hir nose ful semely;
And Frensh she spak ful faire and fetisly,
After the scole of Stratford atte Bowe,                      
For Frensh of Paris was to hir unknowe.
At mete wel y-taught was she with-alle;
She leet no morsel from hir lippes falle,
Ne wette hir fingres in hir sauce depe.
Wel coude she carie a morsel, and wel kepe,                  
That no drope ne fille up-on hir brest.
In curteisye was set ful muche hir lest.
Hir over lippe wyped she so clene,
That in hir coppe was no ferthing sene
Of grece, whan she dronken hadde hir draughte.               
Ful semely after hir mete she raughte,
And sikerly she was of greet disport,
And ful plesaunt, and amiable of port,
And peyned hir to countrefete chere
Of court, and been estatlich of manere,                      
And to ben holden digne of reverence.
But, for to speken of hir conscience,
She was so charitable and so pitous,
She wolde wepe, if that she sawe a mous
Caught in a trappe, if it were deed or bledde.               
Of smale houndes had she, that she fedde
With rosted flesh, or milk and wastel-breed.
But sore weep she if oon of hem were deed,
Or if men smoot it with a yerde smerte:
And al was conscience and tendre herte.                      
Ful semely hir wimpel pinched was;
Hir nose tretys; hir eyen greye as glas;
Hir mouth ful smal, and ther-to softe and reed;
But sikerly she hadde a fair forheed;
It was almost a spanne brood, I trowe;                       
For, hardily, she was nat undergrowe.
Ful fetis was hir cloke, as I was war.
Of smal coral aboute hir arm she bar
A peire of bedes, gauded al with grene;
And ther-on heng a broche of gold ful shene,                 
Another Nonne with hir hadde she,                      
That was hir chapeleyne, and Preestes three.          
A Monk ther was, a fair for the maistrye,                
An out-rydere, that lovede venerye;                          
A manly man, to been an abbot able.
Ful many a deyntee hors hadde he in stable:
And, whan he rood, men mighte his brydel here
Ginglen in a whistling wind as clere,                        
And eek as loude as dooth the chapel-belle,
Ther as this lord was keper of the celle.
The reule of seint Maure or of seint Beneit,
By-cause that it was old and som-del streit,
This ilke monk leet olde thinges pace,                       
And held after the newe world the space.
He yaf nat of that text a pulled hen,
That seith, that hunters been nat holy men;
Ne that a monk, whan he is cloisterlees,
Is lykned til a fish that is waterlees;                      
This is to seyn, a monk out of his cloistre.
But thilke text held he nat worth an oistre;
And I seyde, his opinioun was good.
What sholde he studie, and make him-selven wood,
Upon a book in cloistre alwey to poure,                      
Or swinken with his handes, and laboure,
As Austin bit? How shal the world be served?
Lat Austin have his swink to him reserved.
Therfore he was a pricasour aright;
Grehoundes he hadde, as swifte as fowel in flight;           
Of priking and of hunting for the hare
Was al his lust, for no cost wolde he spare.
I seigh his sleves purfiled at the hond
With grys, and that the fyneste of a lond;
And, for to festne his hood under his chin,                  
He hadde of gold y-wroght a curious pin:
A love-knotte in the gretter ende ther was.
His heed was balled, that shoon as any glas,
And eek his face, as he had been anoint.
He was a lord ful fat and in good point;                     
His eyen stepe, and rollinge in his heed,
That stemed as a forneys of a leed;
His botes souple, his hors in greet estat.
Now certeinly he was a fair prelat;
He was nat pale as a for-pyned goost.                        
A fat swan loved he best of any roost.
His palfrey was as broun as is a berye.
A FRERE ther was, a wantown and a merye,                
A limitour, a ful solempne man.
In alle the ordres foure is noon that can                    
So muche of daliaunce and fair langage.
He hadde maad ful many a mariage
Of yonge wommen, at his owne cost.
Un-to his ordre he was a noble post.
Ful wel biloved and famulier was he                          
With frankeleyns over-al in his contree,
And eek with worthy wommen of the toun:
For he had power of confessioun,
As seyde him-self, more than a curat,
For of his ordre he was licentiat.                           
Ful swetely herde he confessioun,
And plesaunt was his absolucioun;
He was an esy man to yeve penaunce
Ther as he wiste to han a good pitaunce;
For unto a povre ordre for to yive                           
Is signe that a man is wel y-shrive.
For if he yaf, he dorste make avaunt,
He wiste that a man was repentaunt.
For many a man so hard is of his herte,
He may nat wepe al-thogh him sore smerte.                    
Therfore, in stede of weping and preyeres,
Men moot yeve silver to the povre freres.
His tipet was ay farsed ful of knyves
And pinnes, for to yeven faire wyves.
And certeinly he hadde a mery note;                          
Wel coude he singe and pleyen on a rote.
Of yeddinges he bar utterly the prys.
His nekke whyt was as the flour-de-lys;
Ther-to he strong was as a champioun.
He knew the tavernes wel in every toun,                      
And everich hostiler and tappestere
Bet than a lazar or a beggestere;
For un-to swich a worthy man as he
Acorded nat, as by his facultee,
To have with seke lazars aqueyntaunce.                       
It is nat honest, it may nat avaunce
For to delen with no swich poraille,
But al with riche and sellers of vitaille.
And over-al, ther as profit sholde aryse,
Curteys he was, and lowly of servyse.                        
Ther nas no man no-wher so vertuous.
He was the beste beggere in his hous;
For thogh a widwe hadde noght a sho,
So plesaunt was his “In principio,”
Yet wolde he have a ferthing, er he wente.                   
His purchas was wel bettre than his rente.
And rage he coude, as it were right a whelpe.
In love-dayes ther coude he muchel helpe.                  
For there he was nat lyk a cloisterer,
With a thredbar cope, as is a povre scoler,                  
But he was lyk a maister or a pope.
Of double worsted was his semi-cope,
That rounded as a belle out of the presse.
Somwhat he lipsed, for his wantownesse,
To make his English swete up-on his tonge;                   
And in his harping, whan that he had songe,
His eyen twinkled in his heed aright,
As doon the sterres in the frosty night.
For sikerly a prentis revelour,
That haunteth dys, riot, or paramour,
His maister shal it in his shoppe abye,
Al have he no part of the minstralcye;                      
For thefte and riot, they ben convertible,                  
Al conne he pleye on giterne or ribible.
Revel and trouthe, as in a low degree,
They been ful wrothe al day, as men may see.
This Ioly prentis with his maister bood,
Til he were ny out of his prentishood,                      
Al were he snibbed bothe erly and late,
And somtyme lad with revel to Newgate;
But atte laste his maister him bithoghte,
Up-on a day, whan he his paper soghte,                      
Of a proverbe that seith this same word,                    
“Wel bet is roten appel out of hord
Than that it rotie al the remenaunt.”
So fareth it by a riotous servaunt;
It is wel lasse harm to lete him pace,
Than he shende alle the servants in the place.              
Therfore his maister yaf him acquitance,
And bad him go with sorwe and with meschance;
And thus this Ioly prentis hadde his leve.
Now lat him riote al the night or leve.                     
And for ther is no theef with-oute a louke,               
That helpeth him to wasten and to souke
Of that he brybe can or borwe may,
Anon he sente his bed and his array
Un-to a compeer of his owne sort,
That lovede dys and revel and disport,                      
And hadde a wyf that heeld for countenance
A shoppe, and swyved for hir sustenance. 
Now telle on, gentil Roger, by thy name.
But yet I pray thee, be nat wrooth for game,                
A man may seye ful sooth in game and pley.”                 
“Thou seist ful sooth,” quod Roger, “by my fey,
But “sooth pley, quaad pley,” as the Fleming seith;
And ther-fore, Herry Bailly, by thy feith,
Be thou nat wrooth, er we departen heer,
Though that my tale be of an hostileer.                     
But nathelees I wol nat telle it yit,
But er we parte, y-wis, thou shalt be quit.”
And ther-with-al he lough and made chere,
And seyde his tale, as ye shul after here.                  
A prentis whylom dwelled in our citee,                      
And of a craft of vitaillers was he;
Gaillard he was as goldfinch in the shawe,
Broun as a berie, a propre short felawe,
With lokkes blake, y-kempt ful fetisly.
Dauncen he coude so wel and Iolily,                         
That he was cleped Perkin Revelour.
He was as ful of love and paramour
As is the hyve ful of hony swete;
Wel was the wenche with him mighte mete.                    
At every brydale wolde he singe and hoppe,                  
He loved bet the taverne than the shoppe.
For whan ther any ryding was in Chepe,
Out of the shoppe thider wolde he lepe.
Til that he hadde al the sighte y-seyn,
And daunced wel, he wolde nat come ageyn.                   
And gadered him a meinee of his sort
To hoppe and singe, and maken swich disport.
And ther they setten Steven for to mete
To pleyen at the dys in swich a strete.                     
For in the toune nas ther no prentys,                       
That fairer coude caste a paire of dys
Than Perkin coude, and ther-to he was free
Of his dispense, in place of privetee.
That fond his maister wel in his chaffare;
For often tyme he fond his box ful bare.
And graspeth by the walles to and fro,
To finde a staf; and she sterte up also,
And knew the estres bet than dide this Iohn,                
And by the wal a staf she fond, anon,
And saugh a litel shimering of a light,
For at an hole in shoon the mone bright;
And by that light she saugh hem bothe two,
But sikerly she niste who was who,                          
But as she saugh a whyt thing in hir yë.                  
And whan she gan the whyte thing espye,
She wende the clerk hadde wered a volupeer.
And with the staf she drough ay neer and neer,
And wende han hit this Aleyn at the fulle,                  
And smoot the miller on the pyled skulle,
That doun he gooth and cryde, “harrow! I dye!”
Thise clerkes bete him weel and lete him lye;
And greythen hem, and toke hir hors anon,
And eek hir mele, and on hir wey they gon.                  
And at the mille yet they toke hir cake                    
Of half a busshel flour, ful wel y-bake.
Thus is the proude miller wel y-bete,
And hath y-lost the grinding of the whete,
And payed for the soper every-deel                          
Of Aleyn and of Iohn, that bette him weel.
His wyf is swyved, and his doghter als;
Lo, swich it is a miller to be fals!
And therfore this proverbe is seyd ful sooth,
“Him thar nat wene wel that yvel dooth;                     
A gylour shal him-self bigyled be.”                        
And God, that sitteth heighe in magestee,
Save al this companye grete and smale!
Thus have I quit the miller in my tale.
The Cook of London, whyl the Reve spak,                     
For Ioye, him thoughte, he clawed him on the bak,
“Ha! ha!” quod he, “for Cristes passioun,
This miller hadde a sharp conclusioun
Upon his argument of herbergage!
Wel seyde Salomon in his langage,                           
“Ne bringe nat every man in-to thyn hous;”
For herberwing by nighte is perilous.
Wel oghte a man avysed for to be
Whom that he broghte in-to his privetee.                    
I pray to god, so yeve me sorwe and care,                   
If ever, sith I highte Hogge of Ware,
Herde I a miller bettre y-set a-werk.
He hadde a Iape of malice in the derk.
But god forbede that we stinten here;
And therfore, if ye vouche-sauf to here                     
A tale of me, that am a povre man,
I wol yow telle as wel as ever I can
A litel Iape that fil in our citee.”
Our host answerde, and seide, “I graunte it thee;         
Now telle on, Roger, loke that it be good;                  
For many a pastee hastow laten blood,
And many a Iakke of Dover hastow sold
That hath been twyes hoot and twyes cold.
Of many a pilgrim hastow Cristes curs,
For of thy persly yet they fare the wors,                   
That they han eten with thy stubbel-goos;
For in thy shoppe is many a flye loos.
But er thou go, o thing I wol thee telle,                  
Whan that thou wendest homward by the melle,
Right at the entree of the dore bihinde,
Thou shalt a cake of half a busshel finde
That was y-maked of thyn owne mele,                         
Which that I heelp my fader for to stele.
And, gode lemman, god thee save and kepe!”
And with that word almost she gan to wepe.
Aleyn up-rist, and thoughte, “er that it dawe,
I wol go crepen in by my felawe;                            
And fond the cradel with his hand anon,                    
“By god,” thoghte he, “al wrang I have misgon;
Myn heed is toty of my swink to-night,
That maketh me that I go nat aright.
I woot wel by the cradel, I have misgo,                     
Heer lyth the miller and his wyf also.”
And forth he goth, a twenty devel way,
Un-to the bed ther-as the miller lay.
He wende have cropen by his felawe Iohn;
And by the miller in he creep anon,                         
And caughte hym by the nekke, and softe he spak:           
He seyde, “thou, Iohn, thou swynes-heed, awak
For Cristes saule, and heer a noble game.
For by that lord that called is seint Iame,
As I have thryes, in this shorte night,                     
Swyved the milleres doghter bolt-upright,
Whyl thow hast as a coward been agast.”
“Ye, false harlot,” quod the miller, “hast?
A! false traitour! false clerk!” quod he,
“Thou shalt be deed, by goddes dignitee!                    
Who dorste be so bold to disparage                         
My doghter, that is come of swich linage?”
And by the throte-bolle he caughte Alayn.
And he hente hym despitously agayn,
And on the nose he smoot him with his fest.                 
Doun ran the blody streem up-on his brest;
And in the floor, with nose and mouth to-broke,
They walwe as doon two pigges in a poke.
And up they goon, and doun agayn anon,
Til that the miller sporned at a stoon,                     
And doun he fil bakward up-on his wyf,                     
That wiste no-thing of this nyce stryf;
For she was falle aslepe a lyte wight
With Iohn the clerk, that waked hadde al night.
And with the fal, out of hir sleep she breyde--             
“Help, holy croys of Bromeholm,” she seyde,
_In manus tuas!_ lord, to thee I calle!
Awak, Symond! the feend is on us falle,
Myn herte is broken, help, I nam but deed;
There lyth oon up my wombe and up myn heed;                 
Help, Simkin, for the false clerkes fighte.”               
This Iohn sterte up as faste as ever he mighte,
“Allas!” quod he, “this is a wikked Iape;                  
Now may I seyn that I is but an ape.
Yet has my felawe som-what for his harm;
He has the milleris doghter in his arm.
He auntred him, and has his nedes sped,                     
And I lye as a draf-sek in my bed;
And when this Iape is tald another day,
I sal been halde a daf, a cokenay!
I wil aryse, and auntre it, by my fayth!
“Unhardy is unsely,” thus men sayth.”                       
And up he roos and softely he wente                        
Un-to the cradel, and in his hand it hente,
And baar it softe un-to his beddes feet.
Sone after this the wyf hir routing leet,
And gan awake, and wente hir out to pisse,                  
And cam agayn, and gan hir cradel misse,
And groped heer and ther, but she fond noon.
“Allas!” quod she, “I hadde almost misgoon;
I hadde almost gon to the clerkes bed.
By, _benedicite!_ thanne hadde I foule y-sped:“             
And forth she gooth til she the cradel fond.               
She gropeth alwey forther with hir hond,
And fond the bed, and thoghte noght but good,
By-cause that the cradel by it stood,
And niste wher she was, for it was derk;                  
But faire and wel she creep in to the clerk,
And lyth ful stille, and wolde han caught a sleep.
With-inne a whyl this Iohn the clerk up leep,
And on this gode wyf he leyth on sore.
So mery a fit ne hadde she nat ful yore;                    
He priketh harde and depe as he were mad.                  
This Ioly lyf han thise two clerkes lad
Til that the thridde cok bigan to singe.
Aleyn wex wery in the daweninge,
For he had swonken al the longe night;                      
And seyde, “far wel, Malin, swete wight!
The day is come, I may no lenger byde;
But evermo, wher so I go or ryde,
I is thyn awen clerk, swa have I seel!”
“Now dere lemman,” quod she, “go, far weel! 
For which the wardeyn chidde and made fare.
But ther-of sette the miller nat a tare;                    
He craketh boost, and swoor it was nat so.                  
Than were ther yonge povre clerkes two,
That dwelten in this halle, of which I seye.
Testif they were, and lusty for to pleye,
And, only for hir mirthe and revelrye,                      
Up-on the wardeyn bisily they crye,
To yeve hem leve but a litel stounde
To goon to mille and seen hir corn y-grounde;
And hardily, they dorste leye hir nekke,
The miller shold nat stele hem half a pekke                 
Of corn by sleighte, ne by force hem reve;                  
And at the laste the wardeyn yaf hem leve.
Iohn hight that oon, and Aleyn hight that other;
Of o toun were they born, that highte Strother,
Fer in the north, I can nat telle where.                    
This Aleyn maketh redy al his gere,
And on an hors the sak he caste anon.
Forth goth Aleyn the clerk, and also Iohn,
With good swerd and with bokeler by hir syde.
Iohn knew the wey, hem nedede no gyde,                      
And at the mille the sak adoun he layth.                   
Aleyn spak first, “al hayl, Symond, y-fayth;
How fares thy faire doghter and thy wyf?”
“Aleyn! welcome,” quod Simkin, “by my lyf,
And Iohn also, how now, what do ye heer?”                   
“Symond,” quod Iohn, “by god, nede has na peer;
Him boës serve him-selve that has na swayn,
Or elles he is a fool, as clerkes sayn.
Our manciple, I hope he wil be deed,
Swa werkes ay the wanges in his heed.                       
And forthy is I come, and eek Alayn,                       
To grinde our corn and carie it ham agayn;
I pray yow spede us hethen that ye may.”
“It shal be doon,” quod Simkin, “by my fay;
What wol ye doon whyl that it is in hande?”                 
“By god, right by the hoper wil I stande,”
Quod Iohn, “and se how that the corn gas in;
Yet saugh I never, by my fader kin,
How that the hoper wagges til and fra.”
Aleyn answerde, “Iohn, and wiltow swa,                    
Than wil I be bynethe, by my croun,                        
And se how that the mele falles doun
In-to the trough; that sal be my disport.
For Iohn, in faith, I may been of your sort;
I is as ille a miller as are ye.”                           
This miller smyled of hir nycetee,
And thoghte, “al this nis doon but for a wyle;
They wene that no man may hem bigyle;
But, by my thrift, yet shal I blere hir yë
For al the sleighte in hir philosophye.                     
The more queynte crekes that they make,                    
The more wol I stele whan I take.
In stede of flour, yet wol I yeve hem bren.
“The gretteste clerkes been noght the wysest men,”
As whylom to the wolf thus spak the mare;                   
Of al hir art I counte noght a tare.”
Out at the dore he gooth ful prively,
Whan that he saugh his tyme, softely;
He loketh up and doun til he hath founde
The clerkes hors, ther as it stood y-bounde                 
Bihinde the mille, under a levesel;                        
And to the hors he gooth him faire and wel;
He strepeth of the brydel right anon.
And whan the hors was loos, he ginneth gon
Toward the fen, ther wilde mares renne,                     
Forth with wehee, thurgh thikke and thurgh thenne.
This miller gooth agayn, no word he seyde,
But dooth his note, and with the clerkes pleyde,
Til that hir corn was faire and wel y-grounde.
And whan the mele is sakked and y-bounde,                   
This Iohn goth out and fynt his hors away,                 
And gan to crye “harrow“ and “weylaway!
Our hors is lorn! Alayn, for goddes banes,
Step on thy feet, com out, man, al at anes!
Allas, our wardeyn has his palfrey lorn.”                   
This Aleyn al forgat, bothe mele and corn,
Al was out of his mynde his housbondrye.
“What? whilk way is he geen?” he gan to crye.
The wyf cam leping inward with a ren,
She seyde, “allas! your hors goth to the fen                
With wilde mares, as faste as he may go.                   
Unthank come on his hand that bond him so,
And he that bettre sholde han knit the reyne.”
“Allas,” quod Iohn, “Aleyn, for Cristes peyne,
Lay doun thy swerd, and I wil myn alswa;                    
I is ful wight, god waat, as is a raa;
By goddes herte he sal nat scape us bathe.
Why nadstow pit the capul in the lathe?
Il-hayl, by god, Aleyn, thou is a fonne!”
This sely clerkes han ful faste y-ronne                   
To-ward the fen, bothe Aleyn and eek Iohn.                 
And whan the miller saugh that they were gon,
He half a busshel of hir flour hath take,
And bad his wyf go knede it in a cake.
He seyde, “I trowe the clerkes were aferd;                  
Yet can a miller make a clerkes berd
For al his art; now lat hem goon hir weye.
Lo wher they goon, ye, lat the children pleye;
They gete him nat so lightly, by my croun!”
Thise sely clerkes rennen up and doun                     
With “keep, keep, stand, stand, Iossa, warderere,          
Ga whistle thou, and I shal kepe him here!”
But shortly, til that it was verray night,
They coude nat, though they do al hir might,
Hir capul cacche, he ran alwey so faste,                    
Til in a dich they caughte him atte laste.
Wery and weet, as beste is in the reyn,
Comth sely Iohn, and with him comth Aleyn.
“Allas,” quod Iohn, “the day that I was born!
Now are we drive til hething and til scorn.                 
Our corn is stole, men wil us foles calle,                 
Bathe the wardeyn and our felawes alle,
And namely the miller; weylaway!”
Thus pleyneth Iohn as he goth by the way
Toward the mille, and Bayard in his hond.                   
The miller sitting by the fyr he fond,
For it was night, and forther mighte they noght;
But, for the love of god, they him bisoght
Of herberwe and of ese, as for hir peny.
The miller seyde agayn, “if ther be eny,                  
Swich as it is, yet shal ye have your part.                
Myn hous is streit, but ye han lerned art;
Ye conne by argumentes make a place
A myle brood of twenty foot of space.
Lat see now if this place may suffyse,                      
Or make it roum with speche, as is youre gyse.”
“Now, Symond,” seyde Iohn, “by seint Cutberd,
Ay is thou mery, and this is faire answerd.
I have herd seyd, man sal taa of twa thinges
Slyk as he fyndes, or taa slyk as he bringes.               
But specially, I pray thee, hoste dere,                    
Get us som mete and drinke, and make us chere,
And we wil payen trewely atte fulle.
With empty hand men may na haukes tulle;
Lo here our silver, redy for to spende.”                    
This miller in-to toun his doghter sende
For ale and breed, and rosted hem a goos,
And bond hir hors, it sholde nat gon loos;
And in his owne chambre hem made a bed
With shetes and with chalons faire y-spred,                 
Noght from his owne bed ten foot or twelve.                
His doghter hadde a bed, al by hir-selve,
Right in the same chambre, by and by;
It mighte be no bet, and cause why,
Ther was no roumer herberwe in the place.                   
They soupen and they speke, hem to solace,
And drinken ever strong ale atte beste.
Aboute midnight wente they to reste.
Wel hath this miller vernisshed his heed;
Ful pale he was for-dronken, and nat reed.                  
He yexeth, and he speketh thurgh the nose                  
As he were on the quakke, or on the pose.
To bedde he gooth, and with him goth his wyf.
As any Iay she light was and Iolyf,
So was hir Ioly whistle wel y-wet.                          
The cradel at hir beddes feet is set,
To rokken, and to yeve the child to souke.
And whan that dronken al was in the crouke,
To bedde went the doghter right anon;
To bedde gooth Aleyn and also Iohn;                         
Ther nas na more, hem nedede no dwale.                     
This miller hath so wisly bibbed ale,
That as an hors he snorteth in his sleep,
Ne of his tayl bihinde he took no keep.
His wyf bar him a burdon, a ful strong,                     
Men mighte hir routing here two furlong;
The wenche routeth eek par companye.
Aleyn the clerk, that herd this melodye,
He poked Iohn, and seyde, “slepestow?
Herdestow ever slyk a sang er now?                          
Lo, whilk a compline is y-mel hem alle!                    
A wilde fyr up-on thair bodyes falle!
Wha herkned ever slyk a ferly thing?
Ye, they sal have the flour of il ending.
This lange night ther tydes me na reste;                    
But yet, na fors; al sal be for the beste.
For Iohn,” seyde he, “als ever moot I thryve,
If that I may, yon wenche wil I swyve.
Som esement has lawe y-shapen us;
For Iohn, ther is a lawe that says thus,                    
That gif a man in a point be y-greved,                     
That in another he sal be releved.
Our corn is stoln, shortly, it is na nay,
And we han had an il fit al this day.
And sin I sal have neen amendement,                         
Agayn my los I wil have esement.
By goddes saule, it sal neen other be!”
This Iohn answerde, “Alayn, avyse thee,
The miller is a perilous man,” he seyde,
“And gif that he out of his sleep abreyde,                  
He mighte doon us bathe a vileinye.”                       
Aleyn answerde, “I count him nat a flye;”
And up he rist, and by the wenche he crepte.
This wenche lay upright, and faste slepte,
Til he so ny was, er she mighte espye,                      
That it had been to late for to crye,
And shortly for to seyn, they were at on;
Now pley, Aleyn! for I wol speke of Iohn.
This Iohn lyth stille a furlong-wey or two,
And to him-self he maketh routhe and wo:  
And cryden “out“ and “harrow“ in the strete.                
The neighebores, bothe smale and grete,                    
In ronnen, for to gauren on this man,
That yet aswowne he lay, bothe pale and wan;
For with the fal he brosten hadde his arm;
But stonde he moste un-to his owne harm.                    
For whan he spak, he was anon bore doun
With hende Nicholas and Alisoun.
They tolden every man that he was wood,
He was agast so of “Nowelis flood”
Thurgh fantasye, that of his vanitee                        
He hadde y-boght him kneding-tubbes three,                 
And hadde hem hanged in the roof above;
And that he preyed hem, for goddes love,
To sitten in the roof, par companye.
The folk gan laughen at his fantasye;                     
In-to the roof they kyken and they gape,
And turned al his harm un-to a Iape.
For what so that this carpenter answerde,
It was for noght, no man his reson herde;
With othes grete he was so sworn adoun,                     
That he was holden wood in al the toun;                    
For every clerk anon-right heeld with other.
They seyde, “the man is wood, my leve brother;”
And every wight gan laughen of this stryf.
Thus swyved was the carpenteres wyf,                      
For al his keping and his Ialousye;
And Absolon hath kist hir nether yë;
And Nicholas is scalded in the toute.                      
This tale is doon, and god save al the route!               
Whan folk had laughen at this nyce cas                      
Of Absolon and hende Nicholas,
Diverse folk diversely they seyde;
But, for the more part, they loughe and pleyde,
Ne at this tale I saugh no man him greve,
But it were only Osewold the Reve,                          
By-cause he was of carpenteres craft.
A litel ire is in his herte y-laft,
He gan to grucche and blamed it a lyte.
“So theek,” quod he, “ful wel coude I yow quyte           
With blering of a proud milleres yë,                        
If that me liste speke of ribaudye.
But ik am old, me list not pley for age;
Gras-tyme is doon, my fodder is now forage,
This whyte top wryteth myne olde yeres,
Myn herte is al-so mowled as myne heres,                    
But-if I fare as dooth an open-ers;
That ilke fruit is ever leng the wers,
Til it be roten in mullok or in stree.
We olde men, I drede, so fare we;                           
Til we be roten, can we nat be rype;                        
We hoppen ay, whyl that the world wol pype.
For in oure wil ther stiketh ever a nayl,
To have an hoor heed and a grene tayl,
As hath a leek; for thogh our might be goon,
Our wil desireth folie ever in oon.                         
For whan we may nat doon, than wol we speke;
Yet in our asshen olde is fyr y-reke.
Foure gledes han we, whiche I shal devyse,
Avaunting, lying, anger, coveityse;                         
Thise foure sparkles longen un-to elde.                     
Our olde lemes mowe wel been unwelde,
But wil ne shal nat faillen, that is sooth.
And yet ik have alwey a coltes tooth,
As many a yeer as it is passed henne
Sin that my tappe of lyf bigan to renne.                    
For sikerly, whan I was bore, anon
Deeth drogh the tappe of lyf and leet it gon;
And ever sith hath so the tappe y-ronne,
Til that almost al empty is the tonne.                      
The streem of lyf now droppeth on the chimbe;               
The sely tonge may wel ringe and chimbe
Of wrecchednesse that passed is ful yore;
With olde folk, save dotage, is namore.”
Whan that our host hadde herd this sermoning,
He gan to speke as lordly as a king;                        
He seide, “what amounteth al this wit?
What shul we speke alday of holy writ?
The devel made a reve for to preche,
And of a souter a shipman or a leche.                       
Sey forth thy tale, and tarie nat the tyme,                 
Lo, Depeford! and it is half-way pryme.
Lo, Grenewich, ther many a shrewe is inne;
It were al tyme thy tale to biginne.”
“Now, sires,” quod this Osewold the Reve,
“I pray yow alle that ye nat yow greve,                     
Thogh I answere and somdel sette his howve;
For leveful is with force force of-showve.
This dronke millere hath y-told us heer,
How that bigyled was a carpenteer,                          
Peraventure in scorn, for I am oon.                         
And, by your leve, I shal him quyte anoon;
Right in his cherles termes wol I speke.
I pray to god his nekke mote breke;
He can wel in myn yë seen a stalke,
But in his owne he can nat seen a balke.                    
At Trumpington, nat fer fro Cantebrigge,
Ther goth a brook and over that a brigge,
Up-on the whiche brook ther stant a melle;
And this is verray soth that I yow telle.
A Miller was ther dwelling many a day;                      
As eny pecok he was proud and gay.
Pypen he coude and fisshe, and nettes bete,
And turne coppes, and wel wrastle and shete;
And by his belt he baar a long panade,
And of a swerd ful trenchant was the blade.                 
A Ioly popper baar he in his pouche;                        
Ther was no man for peril dorste him touche.
A Sheffeld thwitel baar he in his hose;
Round was his face, and camuse was his nose.
As piled as an ape was his skulle.                          
He was a market-beter atte fulle.
Ther dorste no wight hand up-on him legge,
That he ne swoor he sholde anon abegge.
A theef he was for sothe of corn and mele,
And that a sly, and usaunt for to stele.                    
His name was hoten dëynous Simkin.                          
A wyf he hadde, y-comen of noble kin;
The person of the toun hir fader was.
With hir he yaf ful many a panne of bras,
For that Simkin sholde in his blood allye.                  
She was y-fostred in a nonnerye;
For Simkin wolde no wyf, as he sayde,
But she were wel y-norissed and a mayde,
To saven his estaat of yomanrye.
And she was proud, and pert as is a pye.                    
A ful fair sighte was it on hem two;                        
On haly-dayes biforn hir wolde he go
With his tipet bounden about his heed,
And she cam after in a gyte of reed;
And Simkin hadde hosen of the same.                         
Ther dorste no wight clepen hir but “dame.”
Was noon so hardy that wente by the weye
That with hir dorste rage or ones pleye,
But-if he wolde be slayn of Simkin
With panade, or with knyf, or boydekin.                     
For Ialous folk ben perilous evermo,                        
Algate they wolde hir wyves wenden so.
And eek, for she was somdel smoterlich,
She was as digne as water in a dich;
And ful of hoker and of bisemare.                           
Hir thoughte that a lady sholde hir spare,
What for hir kinrede and hir nortelrye
That she had lerned in the nonnerye.
A doghter hadde they bitwixe hem two
Of twenty yeer, with-outen any mo,                          
Savinge a child that was of half-yeer age;                  
In cradel it lay and was a propre page.
This wenche thikke and wel y-growen was,
With camuse nose and yën greye as glas;
With buttokes brode and brestes rounde and hye,             
But right fair was hir heer, I wol nat lye.
The person of the toun, for she was feir,
In purpos was to maken hir his heir
Bothe of his catel and his messuage,
And straunge he made it of hir mariage.                     
His purpos was for to bistowe hir hye                       
In-to som worthy blood of auncetrye;
For holy chirches good moot been despended
On holy chirches blood, that is descended.
Therfore he wolde his holy blood honoure,                   
Though that he holy chirche sholde devoure.
Gret soken hath this miller, out of doute,
With whete and malt of al the land aboute;
And nameliche ther was a greet collegge,
Men clepen the Soler-halle at Cantebregge,                  
Ther was hir whete and eek hir malt y-grounde.              
And on a day it happed, in a stounde,
Sik lay the maunciple on a maladye;
Men wenden wisly that he sholde dye.
For which this miller stal bothe mele and corn              
An hundred tyme more than biforn;
For ther-biforn he stal but curteisly,
But now he was a theef outrageously,
What eyleth yow? som gay gerl, god it woot,
Hath broght yow thus up-on the viritoot;                    
By sëynt Note, ye woot wel what I mene.”
This Absolon ne roghte nat a bene
Of al his pley, no word agayn he yaf;
He hadde more tow on his distaf
Than Gerveys knew, and seyde, “freend so dere,              
That hote culter in the chimenee here,                     
As lene it me, I have ther-with to done,
And I wol bringe it thee agayn ful sone.”
Gerveys answerde, “certes, were it gold,
Or in a poke nobles alle untold,                            
Thou sholdest have, as I am trewe smith;
Ey, Cristes foo! what wol ye do ther-with?”
“Ther-of,” quod Absolon, “be as be may;
I shal wel telle it thee to-morwe day“--
And caughte the culter by the colde stele.                  
Ful softe out at the dore he gan to stele,                 
And wente un-to the carpenteres wal.
He cogheth first, and knokketh ther-with-al
Upon the windowe, right as he dide er.
This Alison answerde, “Who is ther                        
That knokketh so? I warante it a theef.”
“Why, nay,” quod he, “god woot, my swete leef,
I am thyn Absolon, my dereling!
Of gold,” quod he, “I have thee broght a ring;
My moder yaf it me, so god me save,                         
Ful fyn it is, and ther-to wel y-grave;                    
This wol I yeve thee, if thou me kisse!”
This Nicholas was risen for to pisse,
And thoghte he wolde amenden al the Iape,
He sholde kisse his ers er that he scape.                   
And up the windowe dide he hastily,
And out his ers he putteth prively
Over the buttok, to the haunche-bon;
And ther-with spak this clerk, this Absolon,
“Spek, swete brid, I noot nat wher thou art.”               
This Nicholas anon leet flee a fart,                     
As greet as it had been a thonder-dent,
That with the strook he was almost y-blent;
And he was redy with his iren hoot,
And Nicholas amidde the ers he smoot.                       
Of gooth the skin an hande-brede aboute,
The hole culter brende so his toute,
And for the smert he wende for to dye.
As he were wood, for wo he gan to crye--
Help! water! water! help, for goddes herte!”                
This carpenter out of his slomber sterte,                
And herde oon cryen “water“ as he were wood,
And thoghte, “Allas! now comth Nowelis flood!”
He sit him up with-outen wordes mo,
And with his ax he smoot the corde a-two,                   
And doun goth al; he fond neither to selle,
Ne breed ne ale, til he cam to the celle
Up-on the floor; and ther aswowne he lay.
Up sterte hir Alison, and Nicholay,
And softe he cogheth with a semi-soun--
“What do ye, hony-comb, swete Alisoun?
My faire brid, my swete cinamome,
Awaketh, lemman myn, and speketh to me!                     
Wel litel thenken ye up-on my wo,
That for your love I swete ther I go.
No wonder is thogh that I swelte and swete;
I moorne as doth a lamb after the tete.
Y-wis, lemman, I have swich love-longinge,                  
That lyk a turtel trewe is my moorninge;                   
I may nat ete na more than a mayde.”
“Go fro the window, Iakke fool,” she sayde,
“As help me god, it wol nat be “com ba me,”
I love another, and elles I were to blame,                  
Wel bet than thee, by Iesu, Absolon!
Go forth thy wey, or I wol caste a ston,
And lat me slepe, a twenty devel wey!”
“Allas,” quod Absolon, “and weylawey!
That trewe love was ever so yvel biset!                     
Than kisse me, sin it may be no bet,                       
For Iesus love and for the love of me.”
“Wiltow than go thy wey ther-with?” quod she.
“Ye, certes, lemman,” quod this Absolon.
“Thanne make thee redy,” quod she, “I come anon;”         
And un-to Nicholas she seyde stille,                   
With dust, with sond, with straw, with clooth, with chippes,
But Absolon, that seith ful ofte, “allas!
My soule bitake I un-to Sathanas,                           
But me wer lever than al this toun,” quod he,
“Of this despyt awroken for to be!
Allas!” quod he, “allas! I ne hadde y-bleynt!”
His hote love was cold and al y-queynt;
For fro that tyme that he had kiste hir ers,                
Of paramours he sette nat a kers,                          
For he was heled of his maladye;
Ful ofte paramours he gan deffye,
And weep as dooth a child that is y-bete.
A softe paas he wente over the strete                       
Un-til a smith men cleped daun Gerveys,
That in his forge smithed plough-harneys;
He sharpeth shaar and culter bisily.
This Absolon knokketh al esily,
And seyde, “undo, Gerveys, and that anon.”                  
“What, who artow?” “It am I, Absolon.”                   
“What, Absolon! for Cristes swete tree,
Why ryse ye so rathe, ey, benedicite!   
Til that the belle of laudes gan to ringe,                  
And freres in the chauncel gonne singe.                    
This parish-clerk, this amorous Absolon,
That is for love alwey so wo bigon,
Up-on the Monday was at Oseneye
With companye, him to disporte and pleye,                   
And axed up-on cas a cloisterer
Ful prively after Iohn the carpenter;
And he drough him a-part out of the chirche,
And seyde, “I noot, I saugh him here nat wirche
Sin Saterday; I trow that he be went                        
For timber, ther our abbot hath him sent;                  
For he is wont for timber for to go,
And dwellen at the grange a day or two;
Or elles he is at his hous, certeyn;
Wher that he be, I can nat sothly seyn.”                    
This Absolon ful Ioly was and light,
And thoghte, “now is tyme wake al night;
For sikirly I saugh him nat stiringe
Aboute his dore sin day bigan to springe.
So moot I thryve, I shal, at cokkes crowe,                  
Ful prively knokken at his windowe                         
That stant ful lowe up-on his boures wal.
To Alison now wol I tellen al
My love-longing, for yet I shal nat misse
That at the leste wey I shal hir kisse.                     
Som maner confort shal I have, parfay,
My mouth hath icched al this longe day;
That is a signe of kissing atte leste.
Al night me mette eek, I was at a feste.
Therfor I wol gon slepe an houre or tweye,                  
And al the night than wol I wake and pleye.”               
Whan that the firste cok hath crowe, anon
Up rist this Ioly lover Absolon,
And him arrayeth gay, at point-devys.
But first he cheweth greyn and lycorys,                     
To smellen swete, er he had kembd his heer.
Under his tonge a trewe love he beer,
For ther-by wende he to ben gracious.
He rometh to the carpenteres hous,
And stille he stant under the shot-windowe;                 
Un-to his brest it raughte, it was so lowe; 
I am thy trewe verray wedded wyf;
Go, dere spouse, and help to save our lyf.”                 
Lo! which a greet thyng is affeccioun!
Men may dye of imaginacioun,
So depe may impressioun be take.
This sely carpenter biginneth quake;
Him thinketh verraily that he may see                       
Noës flood come walwing as the see                         
To drenchen Alisoun, his hony dere.
He wepeth, weyleth, maketh sory chere,
He syketh with ful many a sory swogh.
He gooth and geteth him a kneding-trogh,                    
And after that a tubbe and a kimelin,
And prively he sente hem to his in,
And heng hem in the roof in privetee.
His owne hand he made laddres three,
To climben by the ronges and the stalkes                    
Un-to the tubbes hanginge in the balkes,                   
And hem vitailled, bothe trogh and tubbe,
With breed and chese, and good ale in a Iubbe,
Suffysinge right y-nogh as for a day.
But er that he had maad al this array,                      
He sente his knave, and eek his wenche also,
Up-on his nede to London for to go.
And on the Monday, whan it drow to night,
He shette his dore with-oute candel-light,
And dressed al thing as it sholde be.                       
And shortly, up they clomben alle three;                   
They sitten stille wel a furlong-way.
“Now, _Pater-noster_, clom!” seyde Nicholay,
And “clom,” quod John, and “clom,” seyde Alisoun.
This carpenter seyde his devocioun,                         
And stille he sit, and biddeth his preyere,
Awaytinge on the reyn, if he it here.
The dede sleep, for wery bisinesse,
Fil on this carpenter right, as I gesse,
Aboute corfew-tyme, or litel more;                          
For travail of his goost he groneth sore,                  
And eft he routeth, for his heed mislay.
Doun of the laddre stalketh Nicholay,
And Alisoun, ful softe adoun she spedde;
With-outen wordes mo, they goon to bedde                    
Ther-as the carpenter is wont to lye.
Ther was the revel and the melodye;
And thus lyth Alison and Nicholas,
In bisinesse of mirthe and of solas,
That she hadde had a ship hir-self allone.
And ther-fore, wostou what is best to done?
This asketh haste, and of an hastif thing                   
Men may nat preche or maken tarying.                       
Anon go gete us faste in-to this in
A kneding-trogh, or elles a kimelin,
For ech of us, but loke that they be large,
In whiche we mowe swimme as in a barge,                     
And han ther-inne vitaille suffisant
But for a day; fy on the remenant!
The water shal aslake and goon away
Aboute pryme up-on the nexte day.
But Robin may nat wite of this, thy knave,                  
Ne eek thy mayde Gille I may nat save;                     
Axe nat why, for though thou aske me,
I wol nat tellen goddes privetee.
Suffiseth thee, but if thy wittes madde,
To han as greet a grace as Noë hadde.                       
Thy wyf shal I wel saven, out of doute,
Go now thy wey, and speed thee heer-aboute.
But whan thou hast, for hir and thee and me,
Y-geten us thise kneding-tubbes three,
Than shaltow hange hem in the roof ful hye,                 
That no man of our purveyaunce spye.                       
And whan thou thus hast doon as I have seyd,
And hast our vitaille faire in hem y-leyd,
And eek an ax, to smyte the corde atwo
When that the water comth, that we may go,                  
And broke an hole an heigh, up-on the gable,
Unto the gardin-ward, over the stable,
That we may frely passen forth our way
Whan that the grete shour is goon away--
Than shaltow swimme as myrie, I undertake,                  
As doth the whyte doke after hir drake.                    
Than wol I clepe, “how! Alison! how! John!
Be myrie, for the flood wol passe anon.”
And thou wolt seyn, “hayl, maister Nicholay!
Good morwe, I se thee wel, for it is day.”                  
And than shul we be lordes al our lyf
Of al the world, as Noë and his wyf.
But of o thyng I warne thee ful right,
Be wel avysed, on that ilke night
That we ben entred in-to shippes bord,                      
That noon of us ne speke nat a word,                       
Ne clepe, ne crye, but been in his preyere;
For it is goddes owne heste dere.
Thy wyf and thou mote hange fer a-twinne,
For that bitwixe yow shal be no sinne                       
No more in looking than ther shal in dede;
This ordinance is seyd, go, god thee spede!
Tomorwe at night, whan men ben alle aslepe,
In-to our kneding-tubbes wol we crepe,
And sitten ther, abyding goddes grace.                      
Go now thy wey, I have no lenger space                     
To make of this no lenger sermoning.
Men seyn thus, “send the wyse, and sey no-thing;”
Thou art so wys, it nedeth thee nat teche;
Go, save our lyf, and that I thee biseche.”                 
This sely carpenter goth forth his wey.
Ful ofte he seith “allas“ and “weylawey,”
And to his wyf he tolde his privetee;
And she was war, and knew it bet than he,
What al this queynte cast was for to seye.                  
But nathelees she ferde as she wolde deye,                 
And seyde, “allas! go forth thy wey anon,
Help us to scape, or we ben lost echon;
And softer than the wolle is of a wether.
And by hir girdel heeng a purs of lether                    
Tasseld with silk, and perled with latoun.
In al this world, to seken up and doun,
There nis no man so wys, that coude thenche
So gay a popelote, or swich a wenche.
Ful brighter was the shyning of hir hewe                    
Than in the tour the noble y-forged newe.                   
But of hir song, it was as loude and yerne
As any swalwe sittinge on a berne.
Ther-to she coude skippe and make game,
As any kide or calf folwinge his dame.                      
Hir mouth was swete as bragot or the meeth,
Or hord of apples leyd in hey or heeth.
Winsinge she was, as is a Ioly colt,
Long as a mast, and upright as a bolt.
A brooch she baar up-on hir lowe coler,                     
As brood as is the bos of a bocler.                         
Hir shoes were laced on hir legges hye;
She was a prymerole, a pigges-nye
For any lord to leggen in his bedde,
Or yet for any good yeman to wedde.                         
Now sire, and eft sire, so bifel the cas,
That on a day this hende Nicholas
Fil with this yonge wyf to rage and pleye,
Whyl that hir housbond was at Oseneye,
As clerkes ben ful subtile and ful queynte;                 
And prively he caughte hir by the queynte,                  
And seyde, “y-wis, but if ich have my wille,
For derne love of thee, lemman, I spille.”
And heeld hir harde by the haunche-bones,
And seyde, “lemman, love me al at-ones,                     
Or I wol dyen, also god me save!”
And she sprong as a colt doth in the trave,
And with hir heed she wryed faste awey,
And seyde, “I wol nat kisse thee, by my fey,
Why, lat be,” quod she, “lat be, Nicholas,                  
Or I wol crye out “harrow“ and “allas.”                    
Do wey your handes for your curteisye!”
This Nicholas gan mercy for to crye,
And spak so faire, and profred hir so faste,
That she hir love him graunted atte laste,                  
And swoor hir ooth, by seint Thomas of Kent,
That she wol been at his comandement,
Whan that she may hir leyser wel espye.
“Myn housbond is so ful of Ialousye,
That but ye wayte wel and been privee,                      
I woot right wel I nam but deed,” quod she.                
“Ye moste been ful derne, as in this cas.”
“Nay ther-of care thee noght,” quod Nicholas,
“A clerk had litherly biset his whyle,
But-if he coude a Carpenter bigyle.”                        
And thus they been acorded and y-sworn
To wayte a tyme, as I have told biforn.
Whan Nicholas had doon thus everydeel,
And thakked hir aboute the lendes weel,
He kist hir swete, and taketh his sautrye,                  
And pleyeth faste, and maketh melodye.                     
Than fil it thus, that to the parish-chirche,
Cristes owne werkes for to wirche,
This gode wyf wente on an haliday;
Hir forheed shoon as bright as any day,                     
So was it wasshen whan she leet hir werk.
Now was ther of that chirche a parish-clerk,
The which that was y-cleped Absolon.
Crul was his heer, and as the gold it shoon,
And strouted as a fanne large and brode;                    
Ful streight and even lay his Ioly shode.                  
His rode was reed, his eyen greye as goos;
With Powles window corven on his shoos,
In hoses rede he wente fetisly.
Y-clad he was ful smal and proprely,                        
Al in a kirtel of a light wachet;
Ful faire and thikke been the poyntes set.
And ther-up-on he hadde a gay surplys
As whyt as is the blosme up-on the rys.
A mery child he was, so god me save,                        
Wel coude he laten blood and clippe and shave,             
And make a chartre of lond or acquitaunce.
In twenty manere coude he trippe and daunce
After the scole of Oxenforde tho,
And with his legges casten to and fro,                      
And pleyen songes on a small rubible;
Ther-to he song som-tyme a loud quinible;
And as wel coude he pleye on his giterne.
In al the toun nas brewhous ne taverne
That he ne visited with his solas,                          
Ther any gaylard tappestere was.                           
But sooth to seyn, he was somdel squaymous
Of farting, and of speche daungerous.
This Absolon, that Iolif was and gay,
Gooth with a sencer on the haliday,                         
Sensinge the wyves of the parish faste;
And many a lovely look on hem he caste,
And namely on this carpenteres wyf.
To loke on hir him thoughte a mery lyf,
She was so propre and swete and likerous.                   
I dar wel seyn, if she had been a mous,                    
And he a cat, he wolde hir hente anon.
This parish-clerk, this Ioly Absolon,
Hath in his herte swich a love-longinge,
That of no wyf ne took he noon offringe;                    
For curteisye, he seyde, he wolde noon.
The mone, whan it was night, ful brighte shoon,
And Absolon his giterne hath y-take,
For paramours, he thoghte for to wake.
And forth he gooth, Iolif and amorous,                      
Til he cam to the carpenteres hous                         
A litel after cokkes hadde y-crowe;
And dressed him up by a shot-windowe
That was up-on the carpenteres wal.
He singeth in his vois gentil and smal,                     
“Now, dere lady, if thy wille be,
I preye yow that ye wol rewe on me,”
Ful wel acordaunt to his giterninge.
This carpenter awook, and herde him singe,
And spak un-to his wyf, and seyde anon,                     
“What! Alison! herestow nat Absolon                        
That chaunteth thus under our boures wal?”
And she answerde hir housbond ther-with-al,
“Yis, god wot, Iohn, I here it every-del.”
This passeth forth; what wol ye bet than wel?             
Fro day to day this Ioly Absolon
So woweth hir, that him is wo bigon.
He waketh al the night and al the day;
He kempte hise lokkes brode, and made him gay;
He woweth hir by menes and brocage,                         
And swoor he wolde been hir owne page;                     
He singeth, brokkinge as a nightingale;
He sente hir piment, meeth, and spyced ale,
And wafres, pyping hote out of the glede;
And for she was of toune, he profred mede.                  
For som folk wol ben wonnen for richesse,
And som for strokes, and som for gentillesse.
Somtyme, to shewe his lightnesse and maistrye,
He pleyeth Herodes on a scaffold hye.
But what availleth him as in this cas?                      
She loveth so this hende Nicholas,                         
That Absolon may blowe the bukkes horn;
He ne hadde for his labour but a scorn;
And thus she maketh Absolon hir ape,
And al his ernest turneth til a Iape.                       
Ful sooth is this proverbe, it is no lye,
Men seyn right thus, “alwey the nye slye
Maketh the ferre leve to be looth.”
For though that Absolon be wood or wrooth,
By-cause that he fer was from hir sighte,                   
This nye Nicholas stood in his lighte.                     
Now bere thee wel, thou hende Nicholas!
For Absolon may waille and singe “allas.”
And so bifel it on a Saterday,
This carpenter was goon til Osenay;                         
And hende Nicholas and Alisoun
Acorded been to this conclusioun,
That Nicholas shal shapen him a wyle
This sely Ialous housbond to bigyle;
And if so be the game wente aright,                         
She sholde slepen in his arm al night,                     
For this was his desyr and hir also.
And right anon, with-outen wordes mo,
This Nicholas no lenger wolde tarie,
But doth ful softe un-to his chambre carie                  
Bothe mete and drinke for a day or tweye,
And to hir housbonde bad hir for to seye,
If that he axed after Nicholas,
She sholde seye she niste where he was,
Of al that day she saugh him nat with yë;                   
She trowed that he was in maladye,                         
For, for no cry, hir mayde coude him calle;
He nolde answere, for no-thing that mighte falle.
This passeth forth al thilke Saterday,
That Nicholas stille in his chambre lay,                    
And eet and sleep, or dide what him leste,
Til Sonday, that the sonne gooth to reste.
This sely carpenter hath greet merveyle
Of Nicholas, or what thing mighte him eyle,
And seyde, “I am adrad, by seint Thomas,                    
It stondeth nat aright with Nicholas.                      
God shilde that he deyde sodeynly!
This world is now ful tikel, sikerly;
I saugh to-day a cors y-born to chirche
That now, on Monday last, I saugh him wirche.               
Go up,” quod he un-to his knave anoon,
“Clepe at his dore, or knokke with a stoon,
Loke how it is, and tel me boldely.”
This knave gooth him up ful sturdily,
And at the chambre-dore, whyl that he stood,                
He cryde and knokked as that he were wood:--               
“What! how! what do ye, maister Nicholay?
How may ye slepen al the longe day?”
But al for noght, he herde nat a word;
An hole he fond, ful lowe up-on a bord,                     
Ther as the cat was wont in for to crepe;
And at that hole he looked in ful depe,
And at the laste he hadde of him a sighte.
This Nicholas sat gaping ever up-righte,
As he had kyked on the newe mone.                           
Adoun he gooth, and tolde his maister sone                 
In what array he saugh this ilke man.
This carpenter to blessen him bigan,
And seyde, “help us, seinte Frideswyde!
A man woot litel what him shal bityde.                      
This man is falle, with his astromye,
In som woodnesse or in som agonye;
I thoghte ay wel how that it sholde be!
Men sholde nat knowe of goddes privetee.
Ye, blessed be alwey a lewed man,                           
That noght but oonly his bileve can!                       
So ferde another clerk with astromye;
He walked in the feeldes for to prye
Up-on the sterres, what ther sholde bifalle,
Til he was in a marle-pit y-falle;                          
He saugh nat that. But yet, by seint Thomas,
Me reweth sore of hende Nicholas.
He shal be rated of his studying,
If that I may, by Iesus, hevene king!
Get me a staf, that I may underspore,                     
Whyl that thou, Robin, hevest up the dore.                 
He shal out of his studying, as I gesse“--
And to the chambre-dore he gan him dresse.
His knave was a strong carl for the nones,
And by the haspe he haf it up atones;                       
In-to the floor the dore fil anon.
This Nicholas sat ay as stille as stoon,
And ever gaped upward in-to the eir.
This carpenter wende he were in despeir,
And hente him by the sholdres mightily,                     
And shook him harde, and cryde spitously,                  
“What! Nicholay! what, how! what! loke adoun!
Awake, and thenk on Cristes passioun;
I crouche thee from elves and fro wightes!”
Ther-with the night-spel seyde he anon-rightes              
On foure halves of the hous aboute,
And on the threshfold of the dore with-oute:
“Iesu Crist, and seynt Benedight,
Blesse this hous from every wikked wight,
For nightes verye, the white pater-noster!                
Where wentestow, seynt Petres soster?”                     
And atte laste this hende Nicholas
Gan for to syke sore, and seyde, “allas!
Shal al the world be lost eftsones now?”
This carpenter answerde, “what seystow?                   
What! thenk on god, as we don, men that swinke.”
This Nicholas answerde, “fecche me drinke;
And after wol I speke in privetee
Of certeyn thing that toucheth me and thee;
I wol telle it non other man, certeyn.”                     
This carpenter goth doun, and comth ageyn,               
And broghte of mighty ale a large quart;
And whan that ech of hem had dronke his part,
This Nicholas his dore faste shette,
And doun the carpenter by him he sette.                     
He seyde, “Iohn, myn hoste lief and dere,
Thou shall up-on thy trouthe swere me here,
That to no wight thou shalt this conseil wreye;
For it is Cristes conseil that I seye,
And if thou telle it man, thou are forlore;                 
For this vengaunce thou shalt han therfore,                
That if thou wreye me, thou shalt be wood!”
“Nay, Crist forbede it, for his holy blood!”
Quod tho this sely man, “I nam no labbe,
Ne, though I seye, I nam nat lief to gabbe.                 
Sey what thou wolt, I shal it never telle
To child ne wyf, by him that harwed helle!”
“Now John,” quod Nicholas, “I wol nat lye;
I have y-founde in myn astrologye,
As I have loked in the mone bright,                         
That now, a Monday next, at quarter-night,                 
Shal falle a reyn and that so wilde and wood,
That half so greet was never Noës flood.
This world,” he seyde, “in lasse than in an hour
Shal al be dreynt, so hidous is the shour;                  
Thus shal mankynde drenche and lese hir lyf.”
This carpenter answerde, “allas, my wyf!
And shal she drenche? allas! myn Alisoun!”
For sorwe of this he fil almost adoun,
And seyde, “is ther no remedie in this cas?”                
“Why, yis, for gode,” quod hende Nicholas,               
“If thou wolt werken after lore and reed;
Thou mayst nat werken after thyn owene heed.
For thus seith Salomon, that was ful trewe,
“Werk al by conseil, and thou shalt nat rewe.”              
And if thou werken wolt by good conseil,
I undertake, with-outen mast and seyl,
Yet shal I saven hir and thee and me
Hastow nat herd how saved was Noë,
Whan that our lord had warned him biforn                    
That al the world with water sholde be lorn?”              
“Yis,” quod this carpenter, “ful yore ago.”
“Hastow nat herd,” quod Nicholas, “also
The sorwe of Noë with his felawshipe,
Er that he mighte gete his wyf to shipe?                    
Him had be lever, I dar wel undertake,
At thilke tyme, than alle hise wetheres blake,
And ther-to be was sleigh and ful privee,
And lyk a mayden meke for to see.
A chambre hadde he in that hostelrye
Allone, with-outen any companye,
Ful fetisly y-dight with herbes swote;                      
And he him-self as swete as is the rote                     
Of licorys, or any cetewale.
His Almageste and bokes grete and smale,
His astrelabie, longinge for his art,
His augrim-stones layen faire a-part                        
On shelves couched at his beddes heed:
His presse y-covered with a falding reed.
And al above ther lay a gay sautrye,
On which he made a nightes melodye
So swetely, that al the chambre rong;                       
And “Angelus ad virginem” he song;                          
And after that he song the kinges note;
Ful often blessed was his mery throte.
And thus this swete clerk his tyme spente
After his freendes finding and his rente.                   
This Carpenter had wedded newe a wyf
Which that he lovede more than his lyf;
Of eightetene yeer she was of age.
Ialous he was, and heeld hir narwe in cage,
For she was wilde and yong, and he was old                  
And demed him-self ben lyk a cokewold.                      
He knew nat Catoun, for his wit was rude,
That bad man sholde wedde his similitude.
Men sholde wedden after hir estaat,
For youthe and elde is often at debaat.                     
But sith that he was fallen in the snare,
He moste endure, as other folk, his care.
Fair was this yonge wyf, and ther-with-al
As any wesele hir body gent and smal.
A ceynt she werede barred al of silk,                       
A barmclooth eek as whyt as morne milk                      
Up-on hir lendes, ful of many a gore.
Whyt was hir smok, and brouded al bifore
And eek bihinde, on hir coler aboute,
Of col-blak silk, with-inne and eek with-oute.              
The tapes of hir whyte voluper
Were of the same suyte of hir coler;
Hir filet brood of silk, and set ful hye:
And sikerly she hadde a likerous yë.
Ful smale y-pulled were hir browes two,                     
And tho were bent, and blake as any sloo.                   
She was ful more blisful on to see
Than is the newe pere-ionette tree;
Of evel entente, but that I moot reherce
Hir tales alle, be they bettre or werse,
Or elles falsen som of my matere.                           
And therfore, who-so list it nat y-here,
Turne over the leef, and chese another tale;
For he shal finde y-nowe, grete and smale,                  
Of storial thing that toucheth gentillesse,
And eek moralitee and holinesse;                            
Blameth nat me if that ye chese amis.
The Miller is a cherl, ye knowe wel this;
So was the Reve, and othere many mo,
And harlotrye they tolden bothe two.
Avyseth yow and putte me out of blame;                      
And eek men shal nat make ernest of game.
Whylom ther was dwellinge at Oxenford
A riche gnof, that gestes heeld to bord,
And of his craft he was a Carpenter.
With him ther was dwellinge a povre scoler,                 
Had lerned art, but al his fantasye
Was turned for to lerne astrologye,
And coude a certeyn of conclusiouns
To demen by interrogaciouns,
If that men axed him in certein houres,                     
Whan that men sholde have droghte or elles shoures,         
Or if men axed him what sholde bifalle
Of every thing, I may nat rekene hem alle.
This clerk was cleped hende Nicholas;
Of derne love he coude and of solas; 
And seyde: “abyd, Robin, my leve brother,
Som bettre man shal telle us first another:                 
Abyd, and lat us werken thriftily.”
“By goddes soul,” quod he, “that wol nat I;
For I wol speke, or elles go my wey.”
Our Hoste answerde: “tel on, a devel wey!
Thou art a fool, thy wit is overcome.”                      
“Now herkneth,” quod the Miller, “alle and some!
But first I make a protestacioun
That I am dronke, I knowe it by my soun;                    
And therfore, if that I misspeke or seye,
Wyte it the ale of Southwerk, I yow preye;                  
For I wol telle a legende and a lyf
Bothe of a Carpenter, and of his wyf,
How that a clerk hath set the wrightes cappe.”
The Reve answerde and seyde, “stint thy clappe,
Lat be thy lewed dronken harlotrye.                         
It is a sinne and eek a greet folye
To apeiren any man, or him diffame,
And eek to bringen wyves in swich fame.                     
Thou mayst y-nogh of othere thinges seyn.”
This dronken Miller spak ful sone ageyn,                  
And seyde, “leve brother Osewold,
Who hath no wyf, he is no cokewold.
What sholde I more seyn, but this Millere
He nolde his wordes for no man forbere,                     
But tolde his cherles tale in his manere;
Me thinketh that I shal reherce it here.                    
And ther-fore every gentil wight I preye,
For goddes love, demeth nat that I seye
And certeinly a man hath most honour
To dyen in his excellence and flour,                      
Whan he is siker of his gode name;
Than hath he doon his freend, ne him, no shame.             
And gladder oghte his freend ben of his deeth,
Whan with honour up-yolden is his breeth,
Than whan his name apalled is for age;
For al forgeten is his vasselage.
Than is it best, as for a worthy fame,                      
To dyen whan that he is best of name.
The contrarie of al this is wilfulnesse.
Why grucchen we? why have we hevinesse,                   
That good Arcite, of chivalrye flour
Departed is, with duetee and honour,                        
Out of this foule prison of this lyf?
Why grucchen heer his cosin and his wyf
Of his wel-fare that loved hem so weel?
Can he hem thank? nay, God wot, never a deel,
That bothe his soule and eek hem-self offende,              
And yet they mowe hir lustes nat amende.
“What may I conclude of this longe serie,
But, after wo, I rede us to be merie,                     
And thanken Iupiter of al his grace?
And, er that we departen from this place,                   
I rede that we make, of sorwes two,
O parfyt Ioye, lasting ever-mo;
And loketh now, wher most sorwe is her-inne,
Ther wol we first amenden and biginne.
“Suster,” quod he, “this is my fulle assent,              
With al thavys heer of my parlement,
That gentil Palamon, your owne knight,
That serveth yow with wille, herte, and might,            
And ever hath doon, sin that ye first him knewe,
That ye shul, of your grace, up-on him rewe,                
And taken him for housbonde and for lord:
Leen me your hond, for this is our acord.
Lat see now of your wommanly pitee.
He is a kinges brother sone, pardee;
And, though he were a povre bacheler,                       
Sin he hath served yow so many a yeer,
And had for yow so greet adversitee,
It moste been considered, leveth me;                      
For gentil mercy oghte to passen right.”
Than seyde he thus to Palamon ful right;                  
“I trowe ther nedeth litel sermoning
To make yow assente to this thing.
Com neer, and tak your lady by the hond.”
Bitwixen hem was maad anon the bond,
That highte matrimoine or mariage,                          
By al the counseil and the baronage.
And thus with alle blisse and melodye
Hath Palamon y-wedded Emelye.                             
And God, that al this wyde world hath wroght,
Sende him his love, that hath it dere a-boght.              
For now is Palamon in alle wele,
Living in blisse, in richesse, and in hele;
And Emelye him loveth so tendrely,
And he hir serveth al-so gentilly,
That never was ther no word hem bitwene                     
Of Ielousye, or any other tene.
Thus endeth Palamon and Emelye;
And God save al this faire companye!              
Whan that the Knight had thus his tale y-told,
In al the route nas ther yong ne old                        
That he ne seyde it was a noble storie,
And worthy for to drawen to memorie;
And namely the gentils everichoon.
Our Hoste lough and swoor, “so moot I goon,
This gooth aright; unbokeled is the male;                   
Lat see now who shal telle another tale:
For trewely, the game is wel bigonne.
Now telleth ye, sir Monk, if that ye conne,                 
Sumwhat, to quyte with the Knightes tale.”
The Miller, that for-dronken was al pale,                   
So that unnethe up-on his hors he sat,
He nolde avalen neither hood ne hat,
Ne abyde no man for his curteisye,
But in Pilates vois he gan to crye,
And swoor by armes and by blood and bones,                  
“I can a noble tale for the nones,
With which I wol now quyte the Knightes tale.”
Our Hoste saugh that he was dronke of ale,
Unwist of him what was the cause and why;
But in his blake clothes sorwefully                       
He cam at his comaundement in hye.
Tho sente Theseus for Emelye.                               
Whan they were set, and hust was al the place,
And Theseus abiden hadde a space
Er any word cam from his wyse brest,
His eyen sette he ther as was his lest,
And with a sad visage he syked stille,                      
And after that right thus he seyde his wille.
“The firste moevere of the cause above,
Whan he first made the faire cheyne of love,              
Greet was theffect, and heigh was his entente;
Wel wiste he why, and what ther-of he mente;                
For with that faire cheyne of love he bond
The fyr, the eyr, the water, and the lond
In certeyn boundes, that they may nat flee;
That same prince and that moevere,” quod he,
“Hath stablissed, in this wrecched world adoun,             
Certeyne dayes and duracioun
To al that is engendred in this place,
Over the whiche day they may nat pace,                    
Al mowe they yet tho dayes wel abregge;
Ther needeth non auctoritee allegge,                        
For it is preved by experience,
But that me list declaren my sentence.
Than may men by this ordre wel discerne,
That thilke moevere stable is and eterne.
Wel may men knowe, but it be a fool,                        
That every part deryveth from his hool.
For nature hath nat take his beginning
Of no partye ne cantel of a thing,                        
But of a thing that parfit is and stable,
Descending so, til it be corrumpable.                       
And therfore, of his wyse purveyaunce,
He hath so wel biset his ordinaunce,
That speces of thinges and progressiouns
Shullen enduren by successiouns,
And nat eterne be, with-oute lye:                           
This maistow understonde and seen at eye.
“Lo the ook, that hath so long a norisshinge
From tyme that it first biginneth springe,                
And hath so long a lyf, as we may see,
Yet at the laste wasted is the tree.                        
“Considereth eek, how that the harde stoon
Under our feet, on which we trede and goon,
Yit wasteth it, as it lyth by the weye.
The brode river somtyme wexeth dreye.
The grete tounes see we wane and wende.                     
Than may ye see that al this thing hath ende.
“Of man and womman seen we wel also,
That nedeth, in oon of thise termes two,                  
This is to seyn, in youthe or elles age,
He moot ben deed, the king as shal a page;                  
Som in his bed, som in the depe see,
Som in the large feeld, as men may se;
Ther helpeth noght, al goth that ilke weye.
Thanne may I seyn that al this thing moot deye.
What maketh this but Iupiter the king?                      
The which is prince and cause of alle thing,
Converting al un-to his propre welle,
From which it is deryved, sooth to telle.                 
And here-agayns no creature on lyve
Of no degree availleth for to stryve.                       
“Thanne is it wisdom, as it thinketh me,
To maken vertu of necessitee,
And take it wel, that we may nat eschue,
And namely that to us alle is due.
And who-so gruccheth ought, he dooth folye,                 
And rebel is to him that al may gye.
In colpons wel arrayed for to brenne;
His officers with swifte feet they renne                  
And ryde anon at his comaundement.
And after this, Theseus hath y-sent                         
After a bere, and it al over-spradde
With cloth of gold, the richest that he hadde.
And of the same suyte he cladde Arcite;
Upon his hondes hadde he gloves whyte;
Eek on his heed a croune of laurer grene,                   
And in his hond a swerd ful bright and kene.
He leyde him bare the visage on the bere,
Therwith he weep that pitee was to here.                  
And for the peple sholde seen him alle,
Whan it was day, he broghte him to the halle,               
That roreth of the crying and the soun.
Tho cam this woful Theban Palamoun,
With flotery berd, and ruggy asshy heres,
In clothes blake, y-dropped al with teres;
And, passing othere of weping, Emelye,                      
The rewfulleste of al the companye.
In as muche as the service sholde be
The more noble and riche in his degree,                   
Duk Theseus leet forth three stedes bringe,
That trapped were in steel al gliteringe,                   
And covered with the armes of daun Arcite.
Up-on thise stedes, that weren grete and whyte,
Ther seten folk, of which oon bar his sheeld,
Another his spere up in his hondes heeld;
The thridde bar with him his bowe Turkeys,                  
Of brend gold was the cas, and eek the harneys;
And riden forth a pas with sorweful chere
Toward the grove, as ye shul after here.                  
The nobleste of the Grekes that ther were
Upon hir shuldres carieden the bere,                        
With slakke pas, and eyen rede and wete,
Thurgh-out the citee, by the maister-strete,
That sprad was al with blak, and wonder hye
Right of the same is al the strete y-wrye.
Up-on the right hond wente old Egeus,                       
And on that other syde duk Theseus,
With vessels in hir hand of gold ful fyn,
Al ful of hony, milk, and blood, and wyn;                 
Eek Palamon, with ful greet companye;
And after that cam woful Emelye,                            
With fyr in honde, as was that tyme the gyse,
To do thoffice of funeral servyse.
Heigh labour, and ful greet apparaillinge
Was at the service and the fyr-makinge,
That with his grene top the heven raughte,                  
And twenty fadme of brede the armes straughte;
This is to seyn, the bowes were so brode.
Of stree first ther was leyd ful many a lode.             
But how the fyr was maked up on highte,
And eek the names how the treës highte,                     
As ook, firre, birch, asp, alder, holm, popler,
Wilow, elm, plane, ash, box, chasteyn, lind, laurer,
Mapul, thorn, beech, hasel, ew, whippeltree,
How they weren feld, shal nat be told for me;
Ne how the goddes ronnen up and doun,                       
Disherited of hir habitacioun,
In which they woneden in reste and pees,
Nymphes, Faunes, and Amadrides;                           
Ne how the bestes and the briddes alle
Fledden for fere, whan the wode was falle;                  
Ne how the ground agast was of the light,
That was nat wont to seen the sonne bright;
Ne how the fyr was couched first with stree,
And than with drye stokkes cloven a three,
And than with grene wode and spycerye,                      
And than with cloth of gold and with perrye,
And gerlandes hanging with ful many a flour,
The mirre, thencens, with al so greet odour;              
Ne how Arcite lay among al this,
Ne what richesse aboute his body is;                        
Ne how that Emelye, as was the gyse,
Putte in the fyr of funeral servyse;
Ne how she swowned whan men made the fyr,
Ne what she spak, ne what was hir desyr;
Ne what Ieweles men in the fyr tho caste,                   
Whan that the fyr was greet and brente faste;
Ne how som caste hir sheeld, and som hir spere,
And of hir vestiments, whiche that they were,             
And cuppes ful of wyn, and milk, and blood,
Into the fyr, that brente as it were wood;                  
Ne how the Grekes with an huge route
Thryës riden al the fyr aboute
Up-on the left hand, with a loud shoutinge,
And thryës with hir speres clateringe;
And thryës how the ladies gonne crye;                       
Ne how that lad was hom-ward Emelye;
Ne how Arcite is brent to asshen colde;
Ne how that liche-wake was y-holde                        
Al thilke night, ne how the Grekes pleye
The wake-pleyes, ne kepe I nat to seye;                     
Who wrastleth best naked, with oille enoynt,
Ne who that bar him best, in no disioynt.
I wol nat tellen eek how that they goon
Hoom til Athenes, whan the pley is doon;
But shortly to the poynt than wol I wende,                  
And maken of my longe tale an ende.
By processe and by lengthe of certeyn yeres
Al stinted is the moorning and the teres                  
Of Grekes, by oon general assent.
Than semed me ther was a parlement                          
At Athenes, up-on certeyn poynts and cas;
Among the whiche poynts y-spoken was
To have with certeyn contrees alliaunce,
And have fully of Thebans obeisaunce.
For which this noble Theseus anon                           
Leet senden after gentil Palamon,
Whan that hir whelp is stole, whan it is lyte,
So cruel on the hunte, as is Arcite                       
For Ielous herte upon this Palamoun:
Ne in Belmarye ther nis so fel leoun,                       
That hunted is, or for his hunger wood,
Ne of his praye desireth so the blood,
As Palamon to sleen his fo Arcite.
The Ielous strokes on hir helmes byte;
Out renneth blood on bothe hir sydes rede.                  
Som tyme an ende ther is of every dede;
For er the sonne un-to the reste wente,
The stronge king Emetreus gan hente                       
This Palamon, as he faught with Arcite,
And made his swerd depe in his flesh to byte;               
And by the force of twenty is he take
Unyolden, and y-drawe unto the stake.
And in the rescous of this Palamoun
The stronge king Ligurge is born adoun;
And king Emetreus, for al his strengthe,                    
Is born out of his sadel a swerdes lengthe,
So hitte him Palamon er he were take;
But al for noght, he was broght to the stake.             
His hardy herte mighte him helpe naught;
He moste abyde, whan that he was caught                     
By force, and eek by composicioun.
Who sorweth now but woful Palamoun,
That moot namore goon agayn to fighte?
And whan that Theseus had seyn this sighte,
Un-to the folk that foghten thus echoon                     
He cryde, “Ho! namore, for it is doon!
I wol be trewe Iuge, and no partye.
Arcite of Thebes shal have Emelye,                        
That by his fortune hath hir faire y-wonne.”
Anon ther is a noyse of peple bigonne                       
For Ioye of this, so loude and heigh with-alle,
It semed that the listes sholde falle.
What can now faire Venus doon above?
What seith she now? what dooth this quene of love?
But wepeth so, for wanting of hir wille,                    
Til that hir teres in the listes fille;
She seyde: “I am ashamed, doutelees.”
Saturnus seyde: “Doghter, hold thy pees.                  
Mars hath his wille, his knight hath al his bone,
And, by myn heed, thou shalt ben esed sone.”                
The trompes, with the loude minstralcye,
The heraudes, that ful loude yolle and crye,
Been in hir wele for Ioye of daun Arcite.
But herkneth me, and stinteth now a lyte,
Which a miracle ther bifel anon.                            
This fierse Arcite hath of his helm y-don,
And on a courser, for to shewe his face,
He priketh endelong the large place,                      
Loking upward up-on this Emelye;
And she agayn him caste a freendlich yë,                    
(For wommen, as to speken in comune,
They folwen al the favour of fortune),
And she was al his chere, as in his herte.
Out of the ground a furie infernal sterte,
From Pluto sent, at requeste of Saturne,                    
For which his hors for fere gan to turne,
And leep asyde, and foundred as he leep;
And, er that Arcite may taken keep,                       
He pighte him on the pomel of his heed,
That in the place he lay as he were deed,                   
His brest to-brosten with his sadel-bowe.
As blak he lay as any cole or crowe,
So was the blood y-ronnen in his face.
Anon he was y-born out of the place
With herte soor, to Theseus paleys.                         
Tho was he corven out of his harneys,
And in a bed y-brought ful faire and blyve,
For he was yet in memorie and alyve,                      
And alway crying after Emelye.
Duk Theseus, with al his companye,                        
Is comen hoom to Athenes his citee,
With alle blisse and greet solempnitee.
Al be it that this aventure was falle,
He nolde noght disconforten hem alle.
Men seyde eek, that Arcite shal nat dye;                    
He shal ben heled of his maladye.
And of another thing they were as fayn,
That of hem alle was ther noon y-slayn,                   
Al were they sore y-hurt, and namely oon,
That with a spere was thirled his brest-boon.               
To othere woundes, and to broken armes,
Some hadden salves, and some hadden charmes;
Fermacies of herbes, and eek save
They dronken, for they wolde hir limes have.
For which this noble duk, as he wel can,                    
Conforteth and honoureth every man,
And made revel al the longe night,
Un-to the straunge lordes, as was right.                  
Ne ther was holden no disconfitinge,
But as a Iustes or a tourneyinge;                           
For soothly ther was no disconfiture,
For falling nis nat but an aventure;
Ne to be lad with fors un-to the stake
Unyolden, and with twenty knightes take,
O persone allone, with-outen mo,                            
And haried forth by arme, foot, and to,
And eek his stede driven forth with staves,
With footmen, bothe yemen and eek knaves,                 
It nas aretted him no vileinye,
Ther may no man clepen it cowardye.                         
For which anon duk Theseus leet crye,
To stinten alle rancour and envye,
The gree as wel of o syde as of other,
And either syde y-lyk, as otheres brother;
And yaf hem yiftes after hir degree,                        
And fully heeld a feste dayes three;
And conveyed the kinges worthily
Out of his toun a Iournee largely.                        
And hoom wente every man the righte way.
Ther was namore, but “far wel, have good day!”              
Of this bataille I wol namore endyte,
But speke of Palamon and of Arcite.
Swelleth the brest of Arcite, and the sore
Encreesseth at his herte more and more.
The clothered blood, for any lechecraft,                    
Corrupteth, and is in his bouk y-laft,
That neither veyne-blood, ne ventusinge,
Ne drinke of herbes may ben his helpinge.                 
The vertu expulsif, or animal,
Fro thilke vertu cleped natural                             
Ne may the venim voyden, ne expelle.
The pypes of his longes gonne to swelle,
And every lacerte in his brest adoun
Is shent with venim and corrupcioun.
Him gayneth neither, for to gete his lyf,                   
Vomyt upward, ne dounward laxatif;
Al is to-brosten thilke regioun,
Nature hath now no dominacioun.                           
And certeinly, ther nature wol nat wirche,
Far-wel, phisyk! go ber the man to chirche!                 
This al and som, that Arcita mot dye,
For which he sendeth after Emelye,
And Palamon, that was his cosin dere;
Than seyde he thus, as ye shul after here.
“Naught may the woful spirit in myn herte                 
Declare o poynt of alle my sorwes smerte
To yow, my lady, that I love most;
But I biquethe the service of my gost                     
To yow aboven every creature,
Sin that my lyf may no lenger dure.                         
Allas, the wo! allas, the peynes stronge,
That I for yow have suffred, and so longe!
Allas, the deeth! allas, myn Emelye!
Allas, departing of our companye!
Allas, myn hertes quene! allas, my wyf!                     
Myn hertes lady, endere of my lyf!
What is this world? what asketh men to have?
Now with his love, now in his colde grave                 
Allone, with-outen any companye.
Far-wel, my swete fo! myn Emelye!                           
And softe tak me in your armes tweye,
For love of God, and herkneth what I seye.
I have heer with my cosin Palamon
Had stryf and rancour, many a day a-gon,
For love of yow, and for my Ielousye.                       
And Iupiter so wis my soule gye,
To speken of a servant proprely,
With alle circumstaunces trewely,                         
That is to seyn, trouthe, honour, and knighthede,
Wisdom, humblesse, estaat, and heigh kinrede,               
Fredom, and al that longeth to that art,
So Iupiter have of my soule part,
As in this world right now ne knowe I non
So worthy to ben loved as Palamon,
That serveth yow, and wol don al his lyf.                   
And if that ever ye shul been a wyf,
Foryet nat Palamon, the gentil man.”
And with that word his speche faille gan,                 
For from his feet up to his brest was come
The cold of deeth, that hadde him overcome.                 
And yet more-over, in his armes two
The vital strengthe is lost, and al ago.
Only the intellect, with-outen more,
That dwelled in his herte syk and sore,
Gan faillen, when the herte felte deeth,                    
Dusked his eyen two, and failled breeth.
But on his lady yet caste he his yë;
His laste word was, “mercy, Emelye!”                      
His spirit chaunged hous, and wente ther,
As I cam never, I can nat tellen wher.                      
Therfor I stinte, I nam no divinistre;
Of soules finde I nat in this registre,
Ne me ne list thilke opiniouns to telle
Of hem, though that they wryten wher they dwelle.
Arcite is cold, ther Mars his soule gye;                    
Now wol I speken forth of Emelye.
Shrighte Emelye, and howleth Palamon,
And Theseus his suster took anon                          
Swowninge, and bar hir fro the corps away.
What helpeth it to tarien forth the day,                    
To tellen how she weep, bothe eve and morwe?
For in swich cas wommen have swich sorwe,
Whan that hir housbonds been from hem ago,
That for the more part they sorwen so,
Or elles fallen in swich maladye,                           
That at the laste certeinly they dye.
Infinite been the sorwes and the teres
Of olde folk, and folk of tendre yeres,                   
In al the toun, for deeth of this Theban;
For him ther wepeth bothe child and man;                    
So greet a weping was ther noon, certayn,
Whan Ector was y-broght, al fresh y-slayn,
To Troye; allas! the pitee that was ther,
Cracching of chekes, rending eek of heer.
“Why woldestow be deed,” thise wommen crye,                 
“And haddest gold y-nough, and Emelye?”
No man mighte gladen Theseus,
Savinge his olde fader Egeus,                             
That knew this worldes transmutacioun,
As he had seyn it chaungen up and doun,                     
Ioye after wo, and wo after gladnesse:
And shewed hem ensamples and lyknesse.
“Right as ther deyed never man,” quod he,
“That he ne livede in erthe in som degree,
Right so ther livede never man,” he seyde,                  
“In al this world, that som tyme he ne deyde.
This world nis but a thurghfare ful of wo,
And we ben pilgrimes, passinge to and fro;                
Deeth is an ende of every worldly sore.”
And over al this yet seyde he muchel more                   
To this effect, ful wysly to enhorte
The peple, that they sholde hem reconforte.
Duk Theseus, with al his bisy cure,
Caste now wher that the sepulture
Of good Arcite may best y-maked be,                         
And eek most honurable in his degree.
And at the laste he took conclusioun,
That ther as first Arcite and Palamoun                    
Hadden for love the bataille hem bitwene,
That in that selve grove, swote and grene,                  
Ther as he hadde his amorous desires,
His compleynt, and for love his hote fires,
He wolde make a fyr, in which thoffice
Funeral he mighte al accomplice;
And leet comaunde anon to hakke and hewe                    
The okes olde, and leye hem on a rewe
I putte me in thy proteccioun,
Diane, and in thy disposicioun.”
And hoom she gooth anon the nexte weye.                     
This is theffect, ther is namore to seye.
The nexte houre of Mars folwinge this,
Arcite un-to the temple walked is                         
Of fierse Mars, to doon his sacrifyse,
With alle the rytes of his payen wyse.                      
With pitous herte and heigh devocioun,
Right thus to Mars he seyde his orisoun:
“O stronge god, that in the regnes colde
Of Trace honoured art, and lord y-holde,
And hast in every regne and every lond                      
Of armes al the brydel in thyn hond,
And hem fortunest as thee list devyse,
Accept of me my pitous sacrifyse.                         
If so be that my youthe may deserve,
And that my might be worthy for to serve                    
Thy godhede, that I may been oon of thyne,
Than preye I thee to rewe up-on my pyne.
For thilke peyne, and thilke hote fyr,
In which thou whylom brendest for desyr,
Whan that thou usedest the grete beautee                    
Of fayre yonge fresshe Venus free,
And haddest hir in armes at thy wille,
Al-though thee ones on a tyme misfille                    
Whan Vulcanus had caught thee in his las,
And fond thee ligging by his wyf, allas!                    
For thilke sorwe that was in thyn herte,
Have routhe as wel up-on my peynes smerte.
I am yong and unkonning, as thou wost,
And, as I trowe, with love offended most,
That ever was any lyves creature;                           
For she, that dooth me al this wo endure,
Ne reccheth never wher I sinke or flete.
And wel I woot, er she me mercy hete,                     
I moot with strengthe winne hir in the place;
And wel I woot, withouten help or grace                     
Of thee, ne may my strengthe noght availle.
Than help me, lord, to-morwe in my bataille,
For thilke fyr that whylom brente thee,
As wel as thilke fyr now brenneth me;
And do that I to-morwe have victorie.                       
Myn be the travaille, and thyn be the glorie!
Thy soverein temple wol I most honouren
Of any place, and alwey most labouren                     
In thy plesaunce and in thy craftes stronge,
And in thy temple I wol my baner honge,                     
And alle the armes of my companye;
And evere-mo, un-to that day I dye,
Eterne fyr I wol biforn thee finde.
And eek to this avow I wol me binde:
My berd, myn heer that hongeth long adoun,                  
That never yet ne felte offensioun
Of rasour nor of shere, I wol thee yive,
And ben thy trewe servant whyl I live.                    
Now lord, have routhe up-on my sorwes sore,
Yif me victorie, I aske thee namore.”                       
The preyere stinte of Arcita the stronge,
The ringes on the temple-dore that honge,
And eek the dores, clatereden ful faste,
Of which Arcita som-what him agaste.
The fyres brende up-on the auter brighte,                   
That it gan al the temple for to lighte;
And swete smel the ground anon up-yaf,
And Arcita anon his hand up-haf,                          
And more encens in-to the fyr he caste,
With othere rytes mo; and atte laste                        
The statue of Mars bigan his hauberk ringe.
And with that soun he herde a murmuringe
Ful lowe and dim, that sayde thus, “Victorie:“
For which he yaf to Mars honour and glorie.
And thus with Ioye, and hope wel to fare,                   
Arcite anon un-to his inne is fare,
As fayn as fowel is of the brighte sonne.
And right anon swich stryf ther is bigonne              
For thilke graunting, in the hevene above,
Bitwixe Venus, the goddesse of love,                        
And Mars, the sterne god armipotente,
That Iupiter was bisy it to stente;
Til that the pale Saturnus the colde,
That knew so manye of aventures olde,
Fond in his olde experience an art,                         
That he ful sone hath plesed every part.
As sooth is sayd, elde hath greet avantage;
In elde is bothe wisdom and usage;                        
Men may the olde at-renne, and noght at-rede.
Saturne anon, to stinten stryf and drede,                   
Al be it that it is agayn his kynde,
Of al this stryf he gan remedie fynde.
“My dere doghter Venus,” quod Saturne,
“My cours, that hath so wyde for to turne,
Hath more power than wot any man.                           
Myn is the drenching in the see so wan;
Myn is the prison in the derke cote;
Myn is the strangling and hanging by the throte;          
The murmure, and the cherles rebelling,
The groyning, and the pryvee empoysoning:                   
I do vengeance and pleyn correccioun
Whyl I dwelle in the signe of the leoun.
Myn is the ruine of the hye halles,
The falling of the toures and of the walles
Up-on the mynour or the carpenter.                          
I slow Sampsoun in shaking the piler;
And myne be the maladyes colde,
The derke tresons, and the castes olde;                   
My loking is the fader of pestilence.
Now weep namore, I shal doon diligence                      
That Palamon, that is thyn owne knight,
Shal have his lady, as thou hast him hight.
Though Mars shal helpe his knight, yet nathelees
Bitwixe yow ther moot be som tyme pees,
Al be ye noght of o complexioun,                            
That causeth al day swich divisioun.
I am thin ayel, redy at thy wille;
Weep thou namore, I wol thy lust fulfille.”               
Now wol I stinten of the goddes above,
Of Mars, and of Venus, goddesse of love,                    
And telle yow, as pleynly as I can,
The grete effect, for which that I bigan.
Greet was the feste in Athenes that day,
And eek the lusty seson of that May
Made every wight to been in swich plesaunce,                
That al that Monday Iusten they and daunce,
And spenden it in Venus heigh servyse.
But by the cause that they sholde ryse                    
Erly, for to seen the grete fight,
Unto hir reste wente they at night.                         
And on the morwe, whan that day gan springe,
Of hors and harneys, noyse and clateringe
Ther was in hostelryes al aboute;
And to the paleys rood ther many a route
Of lordes, up-on stedes and palfreys.                       
Ther maystow seen devysing of herneys
So uncouth and so riche, and wroght so weel
Of goldsmithrie, of browding, and of steel;               
The sheeldes brighte, testers, and trappures;
Gold-hewen helmes, hauberks, cote-armures;                  
Lordes in paraments on hir courseres,
Knightes of retenue, and eek squyeres
Nailinge the speres, and helmes bokelinge,
Gigginge of sheeldes, with layneres lacinge;
Ther as need is, they weren no-thing ydel;                  
The fomy stedes on the golden brydel
Gnawinge, and faste the armurers also
With fyle and hamer prikinge to and fro;                  
Yemen on fote, and communes many oon
With shorte staves, thikke as they may goon;                
Pypes, trompes, nakers, clariounes,
That in the bataille blowen blody sounes;
The paleys ful of peples up and doun,
Heer three, ther ten, holding hir questioun,
Divyninge of thise Thebane knightes two.                    
Somme seyden thus, somme seyde it shal be so;
Somme helden with him with the blake berd,
Somme with the balled, somme with the thikke-herd;        
Somme sayde, he loked grim and he wolde fighte;
He hath a sparth of twenty pound of wighte.                 
Thus was the halle ful of divyninge,
Longe after that the sonne gan to springe.
The grete Theseus, that of his sleep awaked
With minstralcye and noyse that was maked,
Held yet the chambre of his paleys riche,                   
Til that the Thebane knightes, bothe y-liche
Honoured, were into the paleys fet.
Duk Theseus was at a window set,                          
Arrayed right as he were a god in trone.
The peple preesseth thider-ward ful sone                    
Him for to seen, and doon heigh reverence,
And eek to herkne his hest and his sentence.
An heraud on a scaffold made an ho,
Til al the noyse of the peple was y-do;
And whan he saugh the peple of noyse al stille,             
Tho showed he the mighty dukes wille.
“The lord hath of his heigh discrecioun
Considered, that it were destruccioun                     
To gentil blood, to fighten in the gyse
Of mortal bataille now in this empryse;                     
Wherfore, to shapen that they shul not dye,
He wol his firste purpos modifye.
No man therfor, up peyne of los of lyf,
No maner shot, ne pollax, ne short knyf
Into the listes sende, or thider bringe;                    
Ne short swerd for to stoke, with poynt bytinge,
No man ne drawe, ne bere it by his syde.
Ne no man shal un-to his felawe ryde                      
But o cours, with a sharp y-grounde spere;
Foyne, if him list, on fote, him-self to were.              
And he that is at meschief, shal be take,
And noght slayn, but be broght un-to the stake
That shal ben ordeyned on either syde;
But thider he shal by force, and ther abyde.
And if so falle, the chieftayn be take                      
On either syde, or elles slee his make,
No lenger shal the turneyinge laste.
God spede yow; goth forth, and ley on faste.              
With long swerd and with maces fight your fille.
Goth now your wey; this is the lordes wille.”               
The voys of peple touchede the hevene,
So loude cryden they with mery stevene:
“God save swich a lord, that is so good,
He wilneth no destruccioun of blood!”
Up goon the trompes and the melodye.                        
And to the listes rit the companye
By ordinaunce, thurgh-out the citee large,
Hanged with cloth of gold, and nat with sarge.            
Ful lyk a lord this noble duk gan ryde,
Thise two Thebanes up-on either syde;                       
And after rood the quene, and Emelye,
And after that another companye
Of oon and other, after hir degree.
And thus they passen thurgh-out the citee,
And to the listes come they by tyme.                        
It nas not of the day yet fully pryme,
Whan set was Theseus ful riche and hye,
Ipolita the quene and Emelye,                             
And other ladies in degrees aboute.
Un-to the seetes preesseth al the route.                    
And west-ward, thurgh the gates under Marte,
Arcite, and eek the hundred of his parte,
With baner reed is entred right anon;
And in that selve moment Palamon
Is under Venus, est-ward in the place,                      
With baner whyt, and hardy chere and face.
In al the world, to seken up and doun,
So even with-outen variacioun,                            
Ther nere swiche companyes tweye.
For ther nas noon so wys that coude seye,                   
That any hadde of other avauntage
Of worthinesse, ne of estaat, ne age,
So even were they chosen, for to gesse.
And in two renges faire they hem dresse.
Whan that hir names rad were everichoon,                    
That in hir nombre gyle were ther noon,
Tho were the gates shet, and cryed was loude:
“Do now your devoir, yonge knightes proude!”              
The heraudes lefte hir priking up and doun;
Now ringen trompes loude and clarioun;                      
Ther is namore to seyn, but west and est
In goon the speres ful sadly in arest;
In goth the sharpe spore in-to the syde.
Ther seen men who can Iuste, and who can ryde;
Ther shiveren shaftes up-on sheeldes thikke;                
He feleth thurgh the herte-spoon the prikke.
Up springen speres twenty foot on highte;
Out goon the swerdes as the silver brighte.               
The helmes they to-hewen and to-shrede;
Out brest the blood, with sterne stremes rede.              
With mighty maces the bones they to-breste.
He thurgh the thikkeste of the throng gan threste.
Ther stomblen stedes stronge, and doun goth al.
He rolleth under foot as dooth a bal.
He foyneth on his feet with his tronchoun,                  
And he him hurtleth with his hors adoun.
He thurgh the body is hurt, and sithen y-take,
Maugree his heed, and broght un-to the stake,             
As forward was, right ther he moste abyde;
Another lad is on that other syde.                          
And som tyme dooth hem Theseus to reste,
Hem to refresshe, and drinken if hem leste.
Ful ofte a-day han thise Thebanes two
Togidre y-met, and wroght his felawe wo;
Unhorsed hath ech other of hem tweye.                       
Ther nas no tygre in the vale of Galgopheye,
And as the gyse was in his contree,
Ful hye up-on a char of gold stood he,                    
With foure whyte boles in the trays.
In-stede of cote-armure over his harnays,                   
With nayles yelwe and brighte as any gold,
He hadde a beres skin, col-blak, for-old.
His longe heer was kembd bihinde his bak,
As any ravenes fether it shoon for-blak:
A wrethe of gold arm-greet, of huge wighte,                 
Upon his heed, set ful of stones brighte,
Of fyne rubies and of dyamaunts.
Aboute his char ther wenten whyte alaunts,                
Twenty and mo, as grete as any steer,
To hunten at the leoun or the deer,                         
And folwed him, with mosel faste y-bounde,
Colers of gold, and torets fyled rounde.
An hundred lordes hadde he in his route
Armed ful wel, with hertes sterne and stoute.
With Arcita, in stories as men finde,                     
The grete Emetreus, the king of Inde,
Up-on a stede bay, trapped in steel,
Covered in cloth of gold diapred weel,                    
Cam ryding lyk the god of armes, Mars.
His cote-armure was of cloth of Tars,                       
Couched with perles whyte and rounde and grete.
His sadel was of brend gold newe y-bete;
A mantelet upon his shuldre hanginge
Bret-ful of rubies rede, as fyr sparklinge.
His crispe heer lyk ringes was y-ronne,                     
And that was yelow, and glitered as the sonne.
His nose was heigh, his eyen bright citryn,
His lippes rounde, his colour was sangwyn,                
A fewe fraknes in his face y-spreynd,
Betwixen yelow and somdel blak y-meynd,                     
And as a leoun he his loking caste.
Of fyve and twenty yeer his age I caste.
His berd was wel bigonne for to springe;
His voys was as a trompe thunderinge.
Up-on his heed he wered of laurer grene                     
A gerland fresh and lusty for to sene.
Up-on his hand he bar, for his deduyt,
An egle tame, as eny lilie whyt.                          
An hundred lordes hadde he with him there,
Al armed, sauf hir heddes, in al hir gere,                  
Ful richely in alle maner thinges.
For trusteth wel, that dukes, erles, kinges,
Were gadered in this noble companye,
For love and for encrees of chivalrye.
Aboute this king ther ran on every part                     
Ful many a tame leoun and lepart.
And in this wyse thise lordes, alle and some,
Ben on the Sonday to the citee come                       
Aboute pryme, and in the toun alight.
This Theseus, this duk, this worthy knight,               
Whan he had broght hem in-to his citee,
And inned hem, everich in his degree,
He festeth hem, and dooth so greet labour
To esen hem, and doon hem al honour,
That yet men weneth that no mannes wit                      
Of noon estat ne coude amenden it.
The minstralcye, the service at the feste,
The grete yiftes to the moste and leste,                  
The riche array of Theseus paleys,
Ne who sat first ne last up-on the deys,                    
What ladies fairest been or best daunsinge,
Or which of hem can dauncen best and singe,
Ne who most felingly speketh of love:
What haukes sitten on the perche above,
What houndes liggen on the floor adoun:                     
Of al this make I now no mencioun;
But al theffect, that thinketh me the beste;
Now comth the poynt, and herkneth if yow leste.           
The Sonday night, er day bigan to springe,
When Palamon the larke herde singe,                         
Although it nere nat day by houres two,
Yet song the larke, and Palamon also.
With holy herte, and with an heigh corage
He roos, to wenden on his pilgrimage
Un-to the blisful Citherea benigne,                         
I mene Venus, honurable and digne.
And in hir houre he walketh forth a pas
Un-to the listes, ther hir temple was,                    
And doun he kneleth, and with humble chere
And herte soor, he seyde as ye shul here.                   
“Faireste of faire, o lady myn, Venus,
Doughter to Iove and spouse of Vulcanus,
Thou glader of the mount of Citheroun,
For thilke love thou haddest to Adoun,
Have pitee of my bittre teres smerte,                       
And tak myn humble preyer at thyn herte.
Allas! I ne have no langage to telle
Theffectes ne the torments of myn helle;                  
Myn herte may myne harmes nat biwreye;
I am so confus, that I can noght seye.                      
But mercy, lady bright, that knowest weel
My thought, and seest what harmes that I feel,
Considere al this, and rewe up-on my sore,
As wisly as I shal for evermore,
Emforth my might, thy trewe servant be,                     
And holden werre alwey with chastitee;
That make I myn avow, so ye me helpe.
I kepe noght of armes for to yelpe,                       
Ne I ne axe nat to-morwe to have victorie,
Ne renoun in this cas, ne veyne glorie                      
Of pris of armes blowen up and doun,
But I wolde have fully possessioun
Of Emelye, and dye in thy servyse;
Find thou the maner how, and in what wyse.
I recche nat, but it may bettre be,                         
To have victorie of hem, or they of me,
So that I have my lady in myne armes.
For though so be that Mars is god of armes,               
Your vertu is so greet in hevene above,
That, if yow list, I shal wel have my love,                 
Thy temple wol I worshipe evermo,
And on thyn auter, wher I ryde or go,
I wol don sacrifice, and fyres bete.
And if ye wol nat so, my lady swete,
Than preye I thee, to-morwe with a spere                    
That Arcita me thurgh the herte bere.
Thanne rekke I noght, whan I have lost my lyf,
Though that Arcita winne hir to his wyf.                  
This is theffect and ende of my preyere,
Yif me my love, thou blisful lady dere.”                    
Whan thorisoun was doon of Palamon,
His sacrifice he dide, and that anon
Ful pitously, with alle circumstaunces,
Al telle I noght as now his observaunces.
But atte laste the statue of Venus shook,                   
And made a signe, wher-by that he took
That his preyere accepted was that day.
For thogh the signe shewed a delay,                       
Yet wiste he wel that graunted was his bone;
And with glad herte he wente him hoom ful sone.             
The thridde houre inequal that Palamon
Bigan to Venus temple for to goon,
Up roos the sonne, and up roos Emelye,
And to the temple of Diane gan hye.
Hir maydens, that she thider with hir ladde,                
Ful redily with hem the fyr they hadde,
Thencens, the clothes, and the remenant al
That to the sacrifyce longen shal;                        
The hornes fulle of meth, as was the gyse;
Ther lakked noght to doon hir sacrifyse.                    
Smoking the temple, ful of clothes faire,
This Emelye, with herte debonaire,
Hir body wessh with water of a welle;
But how she dide hir ryte I dar nat telle,
But it be any thing in general;                             
And yet it were a game to heren al;
To him that meneth wel, it were no charge:
But it is good a man ben at his large.                    
Hir brighte heer was kempt, untressed al;
A coroune of a grene ook cerial                             
Up-on hir heed was set ful fair and mete.
Two fyres on the auter gan she bete,
And dide hir thinges, as men may biholde
In Stace of Thebes, and thise bokes olde.
Whan kindled was the fyr, with pitous chere                 
Un-to Diane she spak, as ye may here.
“O chaste goddesse of the wodes grene,
To whom bothe hevene and erthe and see is sene,           
Quene of the regne of Pluto derk and lowe,
Goddesse of maydens, that myn herte hast knowe              
Ful many a yeer, and woost what I desire,
As keep me fro thy vengeaunce and thyn ire,
That Attheon aboughte cruelly.
Chaste goddesse, wel wostow that I
Desire to been a mayden al my lyf,                          
Ne never wol I be no love ne wyf.
I am, thou woost, yet of thy companye,
A mayde, and love hunting and venerye,                    
And for to walken in the wodes wilde,
And noght to been a wyf, and be with childe.                
Noght wol I knowe companye of man.
Now help me, lady, sith ye may and can,
For tho thre formes that thou hast in thee.
And Palamon, that hath swich love to me,
And eek Arcite, that loveth me so sore,                     
This grace I preye thee with-oute more,
As sende love and pees bitwixe hem two;
And fro me turne awey hir hertes so,                      
That al hir hote love, and hir desyr,
And al hir bisy torment, and hir fyr                        
Be queynt, or turned in another place;
And if so be thou wolt not do me grace,
Or if my destinee be shapen so,
That I shal nedes have oon of hem two,
As sende me him that most desireth me.                      
Bihold, goddesse of clene chastitee,
The bittre teres that on my chekes falle.
Sin thou are mayde, and keper of us alle,                 
My maydenhede thou kepe and wel conserve,
And whyl I live a mayde, I wol thee serve.”                 
The fyres brenne up-on the auter clere,
Whyl Emelye was thus in hir preyere;
But sodeinly she saugh a sighte queynte,
For right anon oon of the fyres queynte,
And quiked agayn, and after that anon                       
That other fyr was queynt, and al agon;
And as it queynte, it made a whistelinge,
As doon thise wete brondes in hir brenninge,              
And at the brondes ende out-ran anoon
As it were blody dropes many oon;                           
For which so sore agast was Emelye,
That she was wel ny mad, and gan to crye,
For she ne wiste what it signifyed;
But only for the fere thus hath she cryed,
And weep, that it was pitee for to here.                    
And ther-with-al Diane gan appere,
With bowe in hond, right as an hunteresse,
And seyde: “Doghter, stint thyn hevinesse.                
Among the goddes hye it is affermed,
And by eterne word write and confermed,                     
Thou shalt ben wedded un-to oon of tho
That han for thee so muchel care and wo;
But un-to which of hem I may nat telle.
Farwel, for I ne may no lenger dwelle.
The fyres which that on myn auter brenne                    
Shul thee declaren, er that thou go henne,
Thyn aventure of love, as in this cas.”
And with that word, the arwes in the cas                  
Of the goddesse clateren faste and ringe,
And forth she wente, and made a vanisshinge;                
For which this Emelye astoned was,
And seyde, “What amounteth this, allas!
The cruel ire, reed as any glede;
The pykepurs, and eek the pale drede;                     
The smyler with the knyf under the cloke;
The shepne brenning with the blake smoke;                   
The treson of the mordring in the bedde;
The open werre, with woundes al bi-bledde;
Contek, with blody knyf and sharp manace;
Al ful of chirking was that sory place.
The sleere of him-self yet saugh I ther,                    
His herte-blood hath bathed al his heer;
The nayl y-driven in the shode a-night;
The colde deeth, with mouth gaping up-right.              
Amiddes of the temple sat meschaunce,
With disconfort and sory contenaunce.                       
Yet saugh I woodnesse laughing in his rage;
Armed compleint, out-hees, and fiers outrage.
The careyne in the bush, with throte y-corve:
A thousand slayn, and nat of qualm y-storve;
The tiraunt, with the prey by force y-raft;                 
The toun destroyed, ther was no-thing laft.
Yet saugh I brent the shippes hoppesteres;
The hunte strangled with the wilde beres:                 
The sowe freten the child right in the cradel;
The cook y-scalded, for al his longe ladel.                 
Noght was foryeten by the infortune of Marte;
The carter over-riden with his carte,
Under the wheel ful lowe he lay adoun.
Ther were also, of Martes divisioun,
The barbour, and the bocher, and the smith                  
That forgeth sharpe swerdes on his stith.
And al above, depeynted in a tour,
Saw I conquest sittinge in greet honour,                  
With the sharpe swerde over his heed
Hanginge by a sotil twynes threed.                          
Depeynted was the slaughtre of Iulius,
Of grete Nero, and of Antonius;
Al be that thilke tyme they were unborn,
Yet was hir deeth depeynted ther-biforn,
By manasinge of Mars, right by figure;                      
So was it shewed in that portreiture
As is depeynted in the sterres above,
Who shal be slayn or elles deed for love.                 
Suffyceth oon ensample in stories olde,
I may not rekne hem alle, thogh I wolde.                    
The statue of Mars up-on a carte stood,
Armed, and loked grim as he were wood;
And over his he“ed ther shynen two figures
Of sterres, that been cleped in scriptures,
That oon Puella, that other Rubeus.                         
This god of armes was arrayed thus:--
A wolf ther stood biforn him at his feet
With eyen rede, and of a man he eet;                      
With sotil pencel was depeynt this storie,
In redoutinge of Mars and of his glorie.                    
Now to the temple of Diane the chaste
As shortly as I can I wol me haste,
To telle yow al the descripcioun.
Depeynted been the walles up and doun
Of hunting and of shamfast chastitee.                       
Ther saugh I how woful Calistopee,
Whan that Diane agreved was with here,
Was turned from a womman til a bere,                      
And after was she maad the lode-sterre;
Thus was it peynt, I can say yow no ferre;                  
Hir sone is eek a sterre, as men may see.
Ther saugh I Dane, y-turned til a tree,
I mene nat the goddesse Diane,
But Penneus doughter, which that highte Dane.
Ther saugh I Attheon an hert y-maked,                       
For vengeaunce that he saugh Diane al naked;
I saugh how that his houndes have him caught,
And freten him, for that they knewe him naught.           
Yet peynted was a litel forther-moor,
How Atthalante hunted the wilde boor,                       
And Meleagre, and many another mo,
For which Diane wroghte him care and wo.
Ther saugh I many another wonder storie,
The whiche me list nat drawen to memorie.
This goddesse on an hert ful hye seet,                      
With smale houndes al aboute hir feet;
And undernethe hir feet she hadde a mone,
Wexing it was, and sholde wanie sone.                     
In gaude grene hir statue clothed was,
With bowe in honde, and arwes in a cas.                     
Hir eyen caste she ful lowe adoun,
Ther Pluto hath his derke regioun.
A womman travailinge was hir biforn,
But, for hir child so longe was unborn,
Ful pitously Lucyna gan she calle,                          
And seyde, “help, for thou mayst best of alle.”
Wel couthe he peynten lyfly that it wroghte,
With many a florin he the hewes boghte.                   
Now been thise listes maad, and Theseus,
That at his grete cost arrayed thus                         
The temples and the theatre every del,
Whan it was doon, him lyked wonder wel.
But stinte I wol of Theseus a lyte,
And speke of Palamon and of Arcite.
The day approcheth of hir retourninge,                    
That everich sholde an hundred knightes bringe,
The bataille to darreyne, as I yow tolde;
And til Athenes, hir covenant for to holde,               
Hath everich of hem broght an hundred knightes
Wel armed for the werre at alle rightes.                    
And sikerly, ther trowed many a man
That never, sithen that the world bigan,
As for to speke of knighthod of hir hond,
As fer as God hath maked see or lond,
Nas, of so fewe, so noble a companye.                       
For every wight that lovede chivalrye,
And wolde, his thankes, han a passant name,
Hath preyed that he mighte ben of that game;              
And wel was him, that ther-to chosen was.
For if ther fille to-morwe swich a cas,                     
Ye knowen wel, that every lusty knight,
That loveth paramours, and hath his might,
Were it in Engelond, or elles-where,
They wolde, hir thankes, wilnen to be there.
To fighte for a lady, _benedicite!_                         
It were a lusty sighte for to see.
And right so ferden they with Palamon.
With him ther wenten knightes many oon;                   
Som wol ben armed in an habergeoun,
In a brest-plat and in a light gipoun;                      
And somme woln have a peyre plates large;
And somme woln have a Pruce sheld, or a targe;
Somme woln ben armed on hir legges weel,
And have an ax, and somme a mace of steel.
Ther nis no newe gyse, that it nas old.                     
Armed were they, as I have you told,
Everich after his opinioun.
Ther maistow seen coming with Palamoun                  
Ligurge him-self, the grete king of Trace;
Blak was his berd, and manly was his face.                  
The cercles of his eyen in his heed,
They gloweden bitwixe yelow and reed;
And lyk a griffon loked he aboute,
With kempe heres on his browes stoute;
His limes grete, his braunes harde and stronge,             
His shuldres brode, his armes rounde and longe.
This is to seyn, she may nat now han bothe,
Al be ye never so Ielous, ne so wrothe.                     
And for-thy I yow putte in this degree,
That ech of yow shal have his destinee
As him is shape; and herkneth in what wyse;
Lo, heer your ende of that I shal devyse.
My wil is this, for plat conclusioun,                     
With-outen any replicacioun,
If that yow lyketh, tak it for the beste,
That everich of yow shal gon wher him leste                
Frely, with-outen raunson or daunger;
And this day fifty wykes, fer ne ner,                       
Everich of yow shal bringe an hundred knightes,
Armed for listes up at alle rightes,
Al redy to darreyne hir by bataille.
And this bihote I yow, with-outen faille,
Up-on my trouthe, and as I am a knight,                     
That whether of yow bothe that hath might,
This is to seyn, that whether he or thou
May with his hundred, as I spak of now,                   
Sleen his contrarie, or out of listes dryve,
Him shal I yeve Emelya to wyve,                             
To whom that fortune yeveth so fair a grace.
The listes shal I maken in this place,
And God so wisly on my soule rewe,
As I shal even Iuge been and trewe.
Ye shul non other ende with me maken,                       
That oon of yow ne shal be deed or taken.
And if yow thinketh this is wel y-sayd,
Seyeth your avys, and holdeth yow apayd.                  
This is your ende and your conclusioun.”
Who loketh lightly now but Palamoun?                      
Who springeth up for Ioye but Arcite?
Who couthe telle, or who couthe it endyte,
The Ioye that is maked in the place
Whan Theseus hath doon so fair a grace?
But doun on knees wente every maner wight,                  
And thanked him with al her herte and might,
And namely the Thebans ofte sythe.
And thus with good hope and with herte blythe             
They take hir leve, and hom-ward gonne they ryde
To Thebes, with his olde walles wyde.                       
I trowe men wolde deme it necligence,
If I foryete to tellen the dispence
Of Theseus, that goth so bisily
To maken up the listes royally;
That swich a noble theatre as it was,                       
I dar wel seyn that in this world ther nas.
The circuit a myle was aboute,
Walled of stoon, and diched al with-oute.                 
Round was the shap, in maner of compas,
Ful of degrees, the heighte of sixty pas,                   
That, whan a man was set on o degree,
He letted nat his felawe for to see.
Est-ward ther stood a gate of marbel whyt,
West-ward, right swich another in the opposit.
And shortly to concluden, swich a place                     
Was noon in erthe, as in so litel space;
For in the lond ther nas no crafty man,
That geometrie or ars-metrik can,                         
Ne purtreyour, ne kerver of images,
That Theseus ne yaf him mete and wages                      
The theatre for to maken and devyse.
And for to doon his ryte and sacrifyse,
He est-ward hath, up-on the gate above,
In worship of Venus, goddesse of love,
Don make an auter and an oratorie;                          
And west-ward, in the minde and in memorie
Of Mars, he maked hath right swich another,
That coste largely of gold a fother.                      
And north-ward, in a touret on the wal,
Of alabastre whyt and reed coral                            
An oratorie riche for to see,
In worship of Dyane of chastitee,
Hath Theseus don wroght in noble wyse.
But yet hadde I foryeten to devyse
The noble kerving, and the portreitures,                    
The shap, the countenaunce, and the figures,
That weren in thise oratories three.
First in the temple of Venus maystow see                
Wroght on the wal, ful pitous to biholde,
The broken slepes, and the sykes colde;                     
The sacred teres, and the waymenting;
The fyry strokes of the desiring,
That loves servaunts in this lyf enduren;
The othes, that hir covenants assuren;
Plesaunce and hope, desyr, fool-hardinesse,                 
Beautee and youthe, bauderie, richesse,
Charmes and force, lesinges, flaterye,
Dispense, bisynesse, and Ielousye,                        
That wered of yelwe goldes a gerland,
And a cokkow sitting on hir hand;                           
Festes, instruments, caroles, daunces,
Lust and array, and alle the circumstaunces
Of love, whiche that I rekne and rekne shal,
By ordre weren peynted on the wal,
And mo than I can make of mencioun.                         
For soothly, al the mount of Citheroun,
Ther Venus hath hir principal dwelling,
Was shewed on the wal in portreying,                      
With al the gardin, and the lustinesse.
Nat was foryeten the porter Ydelnesse,                      
Ne Narcisus the faire of yore agon,
Ne yet the folye of king Salamon,
Ne yet the grete strengthe of Hercules--
Thenchauntements of Medea and Circes--
Ne of Turnus, with the hardy fiers corage,                  
The riche Cresus, caytif in servage.
Thus may ye seen that wisdom ne richesse,
Beautee ne sleighte, strengthe, ne hardinesse,            
Ne may with Venus holde champartye;
For as hir list the world than may she gye.                 
Lo, alle thise folk so caught were in hir las,
Til they for wo ful ofte seyde “allas!”
Suffyceth heer ensamples oon or two,
And though I coude rekne a thousand mo.
The statue of Venus, glorious for to see,                 
Was naked fleting in the large see,
And fro the navele doun all covered was
With wawes grene, and brighte as any glas.                
A citole in hir right hand hadde she,
And on hir heed, ful semely for to see,                     
A rose gerland, fresh and wel smellinge;
Above hir heed hir dowves flikeringe.
Biforn hir stood hir sone Cupido,
Up-on his shuldres winges hadde he two;
And blind he was, as it is ofte sene;                       
A bowe he bar and arwes brighte and kene.
Why sholde I noght as wel eek telle yow al
The portreiture, that was up-on the wal                   
With-inne the temple of mighty Mars the rede?
Al peynted was the wal, in lengthe and brede,               
Lyk to the estres of the grisly place,
That highte the grete temple of Mars in Trace,
In thilke colde frosty regioun,
Ther-as Mars hath his sovereyn mansioun.
First on the wal was peynted a foreste,                   
In which ther dwelleth neither man ne beste,
With knotty knarry bareyn treës olde
Of stubbes sharpe and hidous to biholde;                  
In which ther ran a rumbel and a swough,
As though a storm sholde bresten every bough:               
And downward from an hille, under a bente,
Ther stood the temple of Mars armipotente,
Wroght al of burned steel, of which thentree
Was long and streit, and gastly for to see.
And ther-out cam a rage and such a vese,                    
That it made al the gates for to rese.
The northren light in at the dores shoon,
For windowe on the wal ne was ther noon,                  
Thurgh which men mighten any light discerne.
The dores were alle of adamant eterne,                      
Y-clenched overthwart and endelong
With iren tough; and, for to make it strong,
Every piler, the temple to sustene,
Was tonne-greet, of iren bright and shene.
Ther saugh I first the derke imagining                    
Of felonye, and al the compassing;
So ferden they, in chaunging of hir hewe,
As fer as everich of hem other knewe.                      
Ther nas no good day, ne no saluing;
But streight, with-outen word or rehersing,                 
Everich of hem halp for to armen other,
As freendly as he were his owne brother;
And after that, with sharpe speres stronge
They foynen ech at other wonder longe.
Thou mightest wene that this Palamoun                       
In his fighting were a wood leoun,
And as a cruel tygre was Arcite:
As wilde bores gonne they to smyte,                        
That frothen whyte as foom for ire wood.
Up to the ancle foghte they in hir blood.                   
And in this wyse I lete hem fighting dwelle;
And forth I wol of Theseus yow telle.
The destinee, ministre general,
That executeth in the world over-al
The purveyaunce, that God hath seyn biforn,                 
So strong it is, that, though the world had sworn
The contrarie of a thing, by ye or nay,
Yet somtyme it shal fallen on a day                        
That falleth nat eft with-inne a thousand yere.
For certeinly, our appetytes here,                          
Be it of werre, or pees, or hate, or love,
Al is this reuled by the sighte above.
This mene I now by mighty Theseus,
That for to honten is so desirous,
And namely at the grete hert in May,                        
That in his bed ther daweth him no day,
That he nis clad, and redy for to ryde
With hunte and horn, and houndes him bisyde.               
For in his hunting hath he swich delyt,
That it is al his Ioye and appetyt                          
To been him-self the grete hertes bane;
For after Mars he serveth now Diane.
Cleer was the day, as I have told er this,
And Theseus, with alle Ioye and blis,
With his Ipolita, the fayre quene,                          
And Emelye, clothed al in grene,
On hunting be they riden royally.
And to the grove, that stood ful faste by,                 
In which ther was an hert, as men him tolde,
Duk Theseus the streighte wey hath holde.                   
And to the launde he rydeth him ful right,
For thider was the hert wont have his flight,
And over a brook, and so forth on his weye.
This duk wol han a cours at him, or tweye,
With houndes, swiche as that him list comaunde.             
And whan this duk was come un-to the launde,
Under the sonne he loketh, and anon
He was war of Arcite and Palamon,                          
That foughten breme, as it were bores two;
The brighte swerdes wenten to and fro                       
So hidously, that with the leeste strook
It seemed as it wolde felle an ook;
But what they were, no-thing he ne woot.
This duk his courser with his spores smoot,
And at a stert he was bitwix hem two,                       
And pulled out a swerd and cryed, “ho!
Namore, up peyne of lesing of your heed.
By mighty Mars, he shal anon be deed,                      
That smyteth any strook, that I may seen!
But telleth me what mister men ye been,                     
That been so hardy for to fighten here
With-outen Iuge or other officere,
As it were in a listes royally?”
This Palamon answerde hastily,
And seyde: “sire, what nedeth wordes mo?                    
We have the deeth deserved bothe two.
Two woful wrecches been we, two caytyves,
That been encombred of our owne lyves;                     
And as thou art a rightful lord and Iuge,
Ne yeve us neither mercy ne refuge,                         
But slee me first, for seynte charitee;
But slee my felawe eek as wel as me.
Or slee him first; for, though thou knowe it lyte,
This is thy mortal fo, this is Arcite,
That fro thy lond is banished on his heed,                  
For which he hath deserved to be deed.
For this is he that cam un-to thy gate,
And seyde, that he highte Philostrate.                     
Thus hath he Iaped thee ful many a yeer,
And thou has maked him thy chief squyer;                    
And this is he that loveth Emelye.
For sith the day is come that I shal dye,
I make pleynly my confessioun,
That I am thilke woful Palamoun,
That hath thy prison broken wikkedly.                       
I am thy mortal fo, and it am I
That loveth so hote Emelye the brighte,
That I wol dye present in hir sighte.                      
Therfore I axe deeth and my Iuwyse;
But slee my felawe in the same wyse,                        
For bothe han we deserved to be slayn.”
This worthy duk answerde anon agayn,
And seyde, “This is a short conclusioun:
Youre owne mouth, by your confessioun,
Hath dampned you, and I wol it recorde,                     
It nedeth noght to pyne yow with the corde.
Ye shul be deed, by mighty Mars the rede!”
The quene anon, for verray wommanhede,                     
Gan for to wepe, and so dide Emelye,
And alle the ladies in the companye.                        
Gret pitee was it, as it thoughte hem alle,
That ever swich a chaunce sholde falle;
For gentil men they were, of greet estat,
And no-thing but for love was this debat;
And sawe hir blody woundes wyde and sore;                   
And alle cryden, bothe lasse and more,
“Have mercy, lord, up-on us wommen alle!”
And on hir bare knees adoun they falle,                    
And wolde have kist his feet ther-as he stood,
Til at the laste aslaked was his mood;                      
For pitee renneth sone in gentil herte.
And though he first for ire quook and sterte,
He hath considered shortly, in a clause,
The trespas of hem bothe, and eek the cause:
And al-though that his ire hir gilt accused,                
Yet in his reson he hem bothe excused;
As thus: he thoghte wel, that every man
Wol helpe him-self in love, if that he can,                
And eek delivere him-self out of prisoun;
And eek his herte had compassioun                           
Of wommen, for they wepen ever in oon;
And in his gentil herte he thoghte anoon,
And softe un-to himself he seyde: “fy
Up-on a lord that wol have no mercy,
But been a leoun, bothe in word and dede,                   
To hem that been in repentaunce and drede
As wel as to a proud despitous man
That wol maynteyne that he first bigan!                    
That lord hath litel of discrecioun,
That in swich cas can no divisioun,                         
But weyeth pryde and humblesse after oon.”
And shortly, whan his ire is thus agoon,
He gan to loken up with eyen lighte,
And spak thise same wordes al on highte:--
The god of love, a! _benedicite_,                           
How mighty and how greet a lord is he!
Ayeins his might ther gayneth none obstacles,
He may be cleped a god for his miracles;                   
For he can maken at his owne gyse
Of everich herte, as that him list devyse.                  
Lo heer, this Arcite and this Palamoun,
That quitly weren out of my prisoun,
And mighte han lived in Thebes royally,
And witen I am hir mortal enemy,
And that hir deeth lyth in my might also,                   
And yet hath love, maugree hir eyen two,
Y-broght hem hider bothe for to dye!
Now loketh, is nat that an heigh folye?                    
Who may been a fool, but-if he love?
Bihold, for Goddes sake that sit above,                     
Se how they blede! be they noght wel arrayed?
Thus hath hir lord, the god of love, y-payed
Hir wages and hir fees for hir servyse!
And yet they wenen for to been ful wyse
That serven love, for aught that may bifalle!               
But this is yet the beste game of alle,
That she, for whom they han this Iolitee,
Can hem ther-for as muche thank as me;                     
She woot namore of al this hote fare,
By God, than woot a cokkow or an hare!                      
But al mot been assayed, hoot and cold;
A man mot been a fool, or yong or old;
I woot it by my-self ful yore agoon:
For in my tyme a servant was I oon.
And therfore, sin I knowe of loves peyne,                   
And woot how sore it can a man distreyne,
As he that hath ben caught ofte in his las,
I yow foryeve al hoolly this trespas,                      
At requeste of the quene that kneleth here,
And eek of Emelye, my suster dere.                          
And ye shul bothe anon un-to me swere,
That never-mo ye shul my contree dere,
Ne make werre up-on me night ne day,
But been my freendes in al that ye may;
I yow foryeve this trespas every del.”                      
And they him swore his axing fayre and wel,
And him of lordshipe and of mercy preyde,
And he hem graunteth grace, and thus he seyde:             
“To speke of royal linage and richesse,
Though that she were a quene or a princesse,                
Ech of yow bothe is worthy, doutelees,
To wedden whan tyme is, but nathelees
I speke as for my suster Emelye,
For whom ye have this stryf and Ielousye;
Ye woot your-self, she may not wedden two                   
At ones, though ye fighten ever-mo:
That oon of yow, al be him looth or leef,
He moot go pypen in an ivy-leef; 
Of Cadmus, which that was the firste man
That Thebes bulte, or first the toun bigan,                  
And of the citee first was crouned king,
Of his linage am I, and his of-spring                       
By verray ligne, as of the stok royal:
And now I am so caitif and so thral,
That he, that is my mortal enemy,
I serve him as his squyer povrely.
And yet doth Iuno me wel more shame,                        
For I dar noght biknowe myn owne name;
But ther-as I was wont to highte Arcite,
Now highte I Philostrate, noght worth a myte.                
Allas! thou felle Mars, allas! Iuno,
Thus hath your ire our kinrede al fordo,                    
Save only me, and wrecched Palamoun,
That Theseus martyreth in prisoun.
And over al this, to sleen me utterly,
Love hath his fyry dart so brenningly
Y-stiked thurgh my trewe careful herte,                     
That shapen was my deeth erst than my sherte.
Ye sleen me with your eyen, Emelye;
Ye been the cause wherfor that I dye.                      
Of al the remenant of myn other care
Ne sette I nat the mountaunce of a tare,                    
So that I coude don aught to your plesaunce!”
And with that word he fil doun in a traunce
A longe tyme; and after he up-sterte.
This Palamoun, that thoughte that thurgh his herte
He felte a cold swerd sodeynliche glyde,                    
For ire he quook, no lenger wolde he byde.
And whan that he had herd Arcites tale,
As he were wood, with face deed and pale,                  
He sterte him up out of the buskes thikke,
And seyde: “Arcite, false traitour wikke,                   
Now artow hent, that lovest my lady so,
For whom that I have al this peyne and wo,
And art my blood, and to my counseil sworn,
As I ful ofte have told thee heer-biforn,
And hast by-iaped here duk Theseus,                         
And falsly chaunged hast thy name thus;
I wol be deed, or elles thou shalt dye.
Thou shalt nat love my lady Emelye,                        
But I wol love hir only, and namo;
For I am Palamoun, thy mortal fo.                           
And though that I no wepne have in this place,
But out of prison am astert by grace,
I drede noght that outher thou shalt dye,
Or thou ne shalt nat loven Emelye.
Chees which thou wilt, for thou shalt nat asterte.”         
This Arcitë, with ful despitous herte,
Whan he him knew, and hadde his tale herd,
As fiers as leoun, pulled out a swerd,                     
And seyde thus: “by God that sit above,
Nere it that thou art sik, and wood for love,               
And eek that thou no wepne hast in this place,
Thou sholdest never out of this grove pace,
That thou ne sholdest dyen of myn hond.
For I defye the seurtee and the bond
Which that thou seyst that I have maad to thee.             
What, verray fool, think wel that love is free,
And I wol love hir, maugre al thy might!
But, for as muche thou art a worthy knight,                
And wilnest to darreyne hir by batayle,
Have heer my trouthe, to-morwe I wol nat fayle,             
With-outen witing of any other wight,
That here I wol be founden as a knight,
And bringen harneys right y-nough for thee;
And chees the beste, and leve the worste for me.
And mete and drinke this night wol I bringe                 
Y-nough for thee, and clothes for thy beddinge.
And, if so be that thou my lady winne,
And slee me in this wode ther I am inne,                   
Thou mayst wel have thy lady, as for me.”
This Palamon answerde: “I graunte it thee.”                 
And thus they been departed til a-morwe,
When ech of hem had leyd his feith to borwe.
O Cupide, out of alle charitee!
O regne, that wolt no felawe have with thee!
Ful sooth is seyd, that love ne lordshipe                   
Wol noght, his thankes, have no felaweshipe;
Wel finden that Arcite and Palamoun.
Arcite is riden anon un-to the toun,                       
And on the morwe, er it were dayes light,
Ful prively two harneys hath he dight,                      
Bothe suffisaunt and mete to darreyne
The bataille in the feeld bitwix hem tweyne.
And on his hors, allone as he was born,
He carieth al this harneys him biforn;
And in the grove, at tyme and place y-set,                  
This Arcite and this Palamon ben met.
Tho chaungen gan the colour in hir face;
Right as the hunter in the regne of Trace,                 
That stondeth at the gappe with a spere,
Whan hunted is the leoun or the bere,                       
And hereth him come russhing in the greves,
And breketh bothe bowes and the leves,
And thinketh, “heer cometh my mortel enemy,
With-oute faile, he moot be deed, or I;
For outher I mot sleen him at the gappe,                    
Or he mot sleen me, if that me mishappe:“
And shortly, turned was al up-so-doun
Bothe habit and eek disposicioun                           
Of him, this woful lovere daun Arcite.
What sholde I al-day of his wo endyte?                    
Whan he endured hadde a yeer or two
This cruel torment, and this peyne and wo,
At Thebes, in his contree, as I seyde,
Up-on a night, in sleep as he him leyde,
Him thoughte how that the winged god Mercurie               
Biforn him stood, and bad him to be murye.
His slepy yerde in hond he bar uprighte;
An hat he werede up-on his heres brighte.                  
Arrayed was this god (as he took keep)
As he was whan that Argus took his sleep;                   
And seyde him thus: “To Athenes shaltou wende;
Ther is thee shapen of thy wo an ende.”
And with that word Arcite wook and sterte.
“Now trewely, how sore that me smerte,”
Quod he, “to Athenes right now wol I fare;                  
Ne for the drede of deeth shal I nat spare
To see my lady, that I love and serve;
In hir presence I recche nat to sterve.”                   
And with that word he caughte a greet mirour,
And saugh that chaunged was al his colour,                  
And saugh his visage al in another kinde.
And right anoon it ran him in his minde,
That, sith his face was so disfigured
Of maladye, the which he hadde endured,
He mighte wel, if that he bar him lowe,                     
Live in Athenes ever-more unknowe,
And seen his lady wel ny day by day.
And right anon he chaunged his array,                      
And cladde him as a povre laborer,
And al allone, save oonly a squyer,                         
That knew his privetee and al his cas,
Which was disgysed povrely, as he was,
To Athenes is he goon the nexte way.
And to the court he wente up-on a day,
And at the gate he profreth his servyse,                    
To drugge and drawe, what so men wol devyse.
And shortly of this matere for to seyn,
He fil in office with a chamberleyn,                       
The which that dwelling was with Emelye.
For he was wys, and coude soon aspye                        
Of every servaunt, which that serveth here.
Wel coude he hewen wode, and water bere,
For he was yong and mighty for the nones,
And ther-to be was strong and big of bones
To doon that any wight can him devyse.                      
A yeer or two he was in this servyse,
Page of the chambre of Emelye the brighte;
And “Philostrate“ he seide that he highte.                 
But half so wel biloved a man as he
Ne was ther never in court, of his degree;                  
He was so gentil of condicioun,
That thurghout al the court was his renoun.
They seyden, that it were a charitee
That Theseus wolde enhauncen his degree,
And putten him in worshipful servyse,                       
Ther as he mighte his vertu excercyse.
And thus, with-inne a whyle, his name is spronge
Bothe of his dedes, and his goode tonge,                   
That Theseus hath taken him so neer
That of his chambre he made him a squyer,                   
And yaf him gold to mayntene his degree;
And eek men broghte him out of his contree
From yeer to yeer, ful prively, his rente;
But honestly and slyly he it spente,
That no man wondred how that he it hadde.                   
And three yeer in this wyse his lyf he ladde,
And bar him so in pees and eek in werre,
Ther nas no man that Theseus hath derre.                   
And in this blisse lete I now Arcite,
And speke I wol of Palamon a lyte.                          
In derknesse and horrible and strong prisoun
This seven yeer hath seten Palamoun,
Forpyned, what for wo and for distresse;
Who feleth double soor and hevinesse
But Palamon? that love destreyneth so,                      
That wood out of his wit he gooth for wo;
And eek therto he is a prisoner
Perpetuelly, noght oonly for a yeer.                       
Who coude ryme in English proprely
His martirdom? for sothe, it am nat I;                      
Therefore I passe as lightly as I may.
It fel that in the seventhe yeer, in May,
The thridde night, (as olde bokes seyn,
That al this storie tellen more pleyn,)
Were it by aventure or destinee,                            
(As, whan a thing is shapen, it shal be,)
That, sone after the midnight, Palamoun,
By helping of a freend, brak his prisoun,                  
And fleeth the citee, faste as he may go;
For he had yive his gayler drinke so                        
Of a clarree, maad of a certeyn wyn,
With nercotikes and opie of Thebes fyn,
That al that night, thogh that men wolde him shake,
The gayler sleep, he mighte nat awake;
And thus he fleeth as faste as ever he may.                 
The night was short, and faste by the day,
That nedes-cost he moste him-selven hyde,
And til a grove, faste ther besyde,                        
With dredful foot than stalketh Palamoun.
For shortly, this was his opinioun,                         
That in that grove he wolde him hyde al day,
And in the night than wolde he take his way
To Thebes-ward, his freendes for to preye
On Theseus to helpe him to werreye;
And shortly, outher he wolde lese his lyf,                  
Or winnen Emelye un-to his wyf;
This is theffect and his entente pleyn.
Now wol I torne un-to Arcite ageyn,                      
That litel wiste how ny that was his care,
Til that fortune had broght him in the snare.               
The bisy larke, messager of day,
Saluëth in hir song the morwe gray;
And fyry Phebus ryseth up so brighte,
That al the orient laugheth of the lighte,
And with his stremes dryeth in the greves                   
The silver dropes, hanging on the leves.
And Arcite, that is in the court royal
With Theseus, his squyer principal,                        
Is risen, and loketh on the myrie day.
And, for to doon his observaunce to May,                    
Remembring on the poynt of his desyr,
He on a courser, sterting as the fyr,
Is riden in-to the feeldes, him to pleye,
Out of the court, were it a myle or tweye;
And to the grove, of which that I yow tolde,                
By aventure, his wey he gan to holde,
To maken him a gerland of the greves,
Were it of wodebinde or hawethorn-leves,                   
And loude he song ageyn the sonne shene:
“May, with alle thy floures and thy grene,                  
Wel-come be thou, faire fresshe May,
I hope that I som grene gete may.”
And from his courser, with a lusty herte,
In-to the grove ful hastily he sterte,
And in a path he rometh up and doun,                        
Ther-as, by aventure, this Palamoun
Was in a bush, that no man mighte him see,
For sore afered of his deeth was he.                       
No-thing ne knew he that it was Arcite:
God wot he wolde have trowed it ful lyte.                   
But sooth is seyd, gon sithen many yeres,
That “feeld hath eyen, and the wode hath eres.”
It is ful fair a man to bere him evene,
For al-day meteth men at unset stevene.
Ful litel woot Arcite of his felawe,                        
That was so ny to herknen al his sawe,
For in the bush he sitteth now ful stille.
Whan that Arcite had romed al his fille,                 
And songen al the roundel lustily,
In-to a studie he fil sodeynly,                             
As doon thise loveres in hir queynte geres,
Now in the croppe, now doun in the breres,
Now up, now doun, as boket in a welle.
Right as the Friday, soothly for to telle,
Now it shyneth, now it reyneth faste,                       
Right so can gery Venus overcaste
The hertes of hir folk; right as hir day
Is gerful, right so chaungeth she array.                   
Selde is the Friday al the wyke y-lyke.
Whan that Arcite had songe, he gan to syke,               
And sette him doun with-outen any more:
“Alas!” quod he, “that day that I was bore!
How longe, Iuno, thurgh thy crueltee,
Woltow werreyen Thebes the citee?
Allas! y-broght is to confusioun                            
The blood royal of Cadme and Amphioun;
