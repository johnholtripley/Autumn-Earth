Matrix ill affected.<br>
About the beginning of December last she miscarried being 18 weeks gone, since which time she has enjoyed indifferent health but she is now fallen dangerously ill.

She is much oppressed with vomiting. Seldom soluble, but when she takes purges, &amp; then with them by reason of her weakness, she is very sick.<br>

<p>Master Wyllyscot of Berkshire sent for my opinion touching the rags &amp; whites in his water since his cutting Thursday 6 May 1624, 8.45 am. Wrote it 16 April 1624. For preservation from the breeding of another stone.<br>
Stone once cut for it. Is subject to have it still.<br>
His stone four inches round, six inches &amp; a half in length round abo[?] 3 inches &amp; a quarter long.<br>
Drinks next his heart every morning.<br>
He sent me 10s. in gold for my counsel &amp; craved my opinion whence he voids in his urine now [and] then sand, sometimes matter, whitish clots. These do sink down to the bottom of the urinal downy, woolly, linty, cobwebby threads, rags &amp; drags. Sometimes higher or lower in his urine according to their thinness, lightness &amp; heaviness of substance &amp; matter. Proceeding as some think from [1] the ulcer that was in his bladder. 2 others from the foulness of his bladder. 3 others from the back. 4 others from the veins &amp; the whole body generally.<br>
He is desirous to know whence it comes, fearing lest it should be a waste of nature &amp; a weakening of his body.<br>
He was ever of a very thin body. Lean, brown hair, much subject him. He came to man’s state [with?] nocturnal pollutions. &amp; to some looseness of nature upon some little dalliance &amp; carnal provocation &amp; in coitu promptus emittere semen [quick to emit seed during sex] &amp; not with strong ejection of it.<br>
Suspected it might come being to forward to have to do being young with womankind.<br>
[Next column] Since his cutting he finds not in coitus neither that ability nor abundance of nature as formerly, which makes him to think that the abovesaid matter &amp; stuff proceeds to argue for the most part a decaying of nature &amp; want of the former strength of body.<br>
A greedy eating &amp; ingestion at meals but digestion too slow. Egestion slow. Costive naturally.<br>
Since his cutting feels himself more strong &amp; able either on foot or horseback. Indifferent able, good ease &amp; appetite yet errs both in eating &amp; exercise.<br>
He cannot hold his water now so well as when he was sound. He is none of strongest natures.<br>
About the small of his back none of the strongest. If he sleeps any space of time, in his back bending again he feels a weakness.<br>
If his meat offend him, he feels it not at dinner but at supper till towards supper time &amp; his supper will not till after his first sleep.<br>
If since his cutting he take any cassia or turp[entine] for preserve or if he use violent exercise, he shall void more or less sand &amp; going to stool &amp; making of water feels some burning in the neck of his bladder. &amp; offence as formerly. Although before taking of it was at good ease &amp; did see no sand expelled in the space of weeks.<br>
Would use some present physic lest the stone should increase. Yet on the other side a fear of overmuch tempering [tampering] &amp; meddling will make him weaker &amp; worse.<br>

Was much troubled in her mind for one that she had loved long &amp; ago who is now married &amp; she meeting him of late told him that if her old husband dies that then she will marry him, but she meant it not as she told me because that his wife is living. Her husband is 80 years old &amp; does whip her &amp; scourge her black &amp; blue egged on by his child. Casts all that she takes. Cannot rest nor sleep. Is somewhat wild &amp; feels not the ground on which she goes. Troubled in her mind. Is much tempted by Satan that comes unto her in the likeness of a cat &amp; tells her that Satan laboured to drown &amp; to hang herself by Satan’s temptation.<br>

His ground is haunted &amp; treasure is hid there as the report goes. There is heard much music &amp; melody. This Gryphen Crocker has seen lights. The parson of Elsborough 16, 17, 18 years since delivered a note out of a book unto Henry Ginger that now dwells at Wigginton in Hertfordshire, an old man of 80 years. As follows: Elsborough church &amp; Little Kymble church of the right side of the way even against the castle hill there lies of gold &amp; silver &amp; jewels, brass &amp; pewter. A wain load laid in by lord Everet Knotsby &amp; his man at the conquest. This was all that was delivered him in a note, which he lost, willing him to enquire further for he himself saw often a great light which has been seen since by many since his death. &amp; sometimes there will appear a thing like a black hog &amp; very lately seen a white cat with a marvellous long &amp; great tail which ran into a pond. Music heard lately by Crockwell &amp; his wife &amp; children. Henry Ginger within those 2 years when some came to seek this treasure saw a white bullock without ears &amp; horns. &amp; others saw a fair gentlewoman. A lion, an antelope, a friar with a grey cloak cast upon his shoulders. But none could find the treasure.<br>
