She seems to be with child by Moon in 5° and yet she has her course every month. But because Moon does approach to the square of Mars in the 8th house it seems she will strain herself and spoil it. She has gone between 9 and 10 weeks.<br />

[Right of chart] Try this. Utrum sit gravida [whether pregnant].<br />
[Astrology] ergo gravida [therefore pregnant]. This woman supposes herself with child &amp; there is a great presumption of it because Venus is lady of the ascendant and is applying to Saturn, lord of the fifth house. But she is pained in the reins, belly &amp; stuffed in the stomach. Of Jupiter in Gemini, Moon separating from Mercury. She is not sick. And she has not her course but it seems she will be with child shortly. She is with child of 7 weeks.<br />

			<p>Mary Blakborowe of Tilshead in Wiltshire, 43 years. Friday 31 May 1633, 7.40 pm.<br />
[Chart.]<br />
Matrix ill affected.<br />
About the beginning of December last she miscarried being 18 weeks gone, since which time she has enjoyed indifferent health but she is now fallen dangerously ill. Some think her infirmity to be a quartain, others a hectic fever, both agree that the spleen is much out of order with a great deal of rawness. She is often troubled with the stone, being costive. She is much oppressed with vomiting. Seldom soluble, but when she takes purges, &amp; then with them by reason of her weakness, she is very sick.<br />
[Lengthy treatment information, including clysters, and a substance to be used ‘blood warm, injecting it in a metrinchita into the matrix, every day at 3 in the afternoon for a week together.’]<br />

			<p>Master Wyllyscot of Berkshire sent for my opinion touching the rags &amp; whites in his water since his cutting Thursday 6 May 1624, 8.45 am. Wrote it 16 April 1624. For preservation from the breeding of another stone.<br />
[In chart] Stone once cut for it. Is subject to have it still.<br />
[To right of chart] His stone four inches round, six inches &amp; a half in length round abo[?] 3 inches &amp; a quarter long.<br />
Drinks next his heart every morning.<br />
He sent me 10s. in gold for my counsel &amp; craved my opinion whence he voids in his urine now [and] then sand, sometimes matter, whitish clots. These do sink down to the bottom of the urinal downy, woolly, linty, cobwebby threads, rags &amp; drags. Sometimes higher or lower in his urine according to their thinness, lightness &amp; heaviness of substance &amp; matter. Proceeding as some think from [1] the ulcer that was in his bladder. 2 others from the foulness of his bladder. 3 others from the back. 4 others from the veins &amp; the whole body generally.<br />
He is desirous to know whence it comes, fearing lest it should be a waste of nature &amp; a weakening of his body.<br />
He was ever of a very thin body. Lean, brown hair, much subject him. He came to man’s state [with?] nocturnal pollutions. &amp; to some looseness of nature upon some little dalliance &amp; carnal provocation &amp; in coitu promptus emittere semen [quick to emit seed during sex] &amp; not with strong ejection of it.<br />
Suspected it might come being to forward to have to do being young with womankind.<br />
[Next column] Since his cutting he finds not in coitus neither that ability nor abundance of nature as formerly, which makes him to think that the abovesaid matter &amp; stuff proceeds to argue for the most part a decaying of nature &amp; want of the former strength of body.<br />
A greedy eating &amp; ingestion at meals but digestion too slow. Egestion slow. Costive naturally.<br />
Since his cutting feels himself more strong &amp; able either on foot or horseback. Indifferent able, good ease &amp; appetite yet errs both in eating &amp; exercise.<br />
He cannot hold his water now so well as when he was sound. He is none of strongest natures.<br />
About the small of his back none of the strongest. If he sleeps any space of time, in his back bending again he feels a weakness.<br />
If his meat offend him, he feels it not at dinner but at supper till towards supper time &amp; his supper will not till after his first sleep.<br />
If since his cutting he take any cassia or turp[entine] for preserve or if he use violent exercise, he shall void more or less sand &amp; going to stool &amp; making of water feels some burning in the neck of his bladder. &amp; offence as formerly. Although before taking of it was at good ease &amp; did see no sand expelled in the space of weeks.<br />
Would use some present physic lest the stone should increase. Yet on the other side a fear of overmuch tempering [tampering] &amp; meddling will make him weaker &amp; worse.<br />

			<p>For a greyhound lost of my Lord of Cumberland which broke loose in William Holman’s house in Water Lane. Thursday 2 January 1595, 8 am.<br />
[Chart.]<br />
This dog after he broke loose he ran straight to Charter House which is right north north west from Water Lane. And from thence to Gray’s Inn Fields and there was taken up by a leather dresser the same day. And he sold the dog to a tapster for 5s. And the tapster did use to carry him out daily into Grays Inn Fields where the dog was espied by one that knows him.<br />
Mercury lord of the 6th retrograde signifier of the dog. In 12 degrees in signal. Says the dog shall be had again because Sun is joined to the ascendant.<br />
The distance between the dog now and the place from which he went is signified by distance of the ascendant between Saturn &amp; Moon which is 25 minutes which signifies a mile and better. Under pars fortuna because it is in fixed signs &amp; in angels.<br />
[Case 79952 is a second question for the same dog, ‘found again the 9 of January in Grays Inn Fields.’]<br />

She was likely the other day by the fall of a rotten barn to have been maimed. Has taken much grief. She will not now come to the her friend’s house as he was wont. Has taken much grief.<br />
Let her talk with him September 21.<br />

			<p>Anne Edmonds of London, 34 years. Saturday 18 December 1628, 6 pm.<br />
[Right of page, running to bottom] My advice for her falling out with a woman, her landlady, midsummer last a twelvemonth. Fell out with her, &amp; struck her about a sister in law of hers that lived with Mrs Edmonds. She struck her &amp; gave her cursed words &amp; one that followed her boy being 9 months old. Put her boy into a strange fit &amp; so continued a good while &amp; died in the end of the fever fits. The doctors said it was in shifting the boy into another house. Had no more fits for 14 weeks after. Then her lord lady’s sister her maid was warned by her to go out of her service. And Goody Crosse that had gotten her aforetimes &amp; the maid leaving her to come to her old mistress that Goody Crosse that did help her to a service came railing to her &amp; cursing Mistress Edmonds with bitter curses &amp; said that she would make her to repent it for keeping of her servant. So her child fell into these fits again &amp; so continued with 20, 30, 40 fits a day until it died. &amp; the mother Mistress Edmonds dreamed that a woman did bewitch her child &amp; Dr Lamb told her that Goody Crosse had bewitched her boy.<br />
[Chart.]<br />
And for herself is fallen into the same fits and craves my counsel. This Mistress Crosse did say that she did no more against her child than what she was set on.<br />

			<p>Michael Adams of Over, 43 years. Wednesday 31 May 1626, 7.00 am.<br />
[In chart] A mind much troubled with false conceits &amp; illusions.<br />
Melancholy false fears touching Satan’s illusions. Fearfulness of sin. Apt to sleep. Mr Baker wrote in his behalf. Fearful dreams. Yet when he would sleep supposes he sees many things which he sees not. A mist in his eyes, a giddiness in his head, an inclination to the falling sickness, a thing rising up out of the lower part of his stomach up to his head.<br />

			<p>Joan Hawkins of Marson, 43 years. Tuesday 3 June 1634, 10.00 am.<br />

Has been sick these 8 weeks. Pained in her chest, stomach, heart, back. Sometimes pulled &amp; pinched in her belly. Sleeps pretty well. Spits much. Body soluble. Has had a vomit. Was let blood by Dr Bannister’s counsel.<br />
[Astrology; Treatment information, including a clyster and a cordial.]<br />
Their house has been much troubled these 2 years&#8217; space. Something haunting it many nights together yet never did any hurt to them but makes a noise &amp; throws things about &amp; plays many unhappy tricks. Always comes in the night &amp; never heard till the candle be out.<br />
Upon this they removed their house. It followed them &amp; since leaving that it haunts them where they are.<br />
She has but one child &amp; that has been as it were stricken ill. 4 years since &amp; is lame all of one side. Has the falling sickness &amp; dead palsy together.<br />
It had ointments &amp; other things of my uncle &amp; a sigil of tin/Jupiter.<br />
It should seem she has taken much grief at it and some conceit that her house is haunted.<br />

			<p>Robert Mathews’ brother-in-law of Whitfield came again for him. Tuesday 18 January 1603, 1.00 pm. Vide [see] January 11. He was Mr Thomas Spenser&#8217;s clerk. And took a surfeit and was drunken at London. After which time he took such a conceit that he was never well after, but his master’s maids made him believe sometimes that one of them loved him and sometimes another so that at length his mind ran altogether upon their love and he became sottish and now speaks he cannot tell what and talks idly never ceasing as long as he has any company. He sleeps well and eats whatever is given him.<br />

			<p>Michael Adams of Over, 43 years. Wednesday 31 May 1626, 7.00 am.<br />
[In chart] A mind much troubled with false conceits &amp; illusions.<br />
Melancholy. False fears touching Satan’s illusions. Fearfulness of sin. Mr Baker wrote in his behalf. Fearful dreams. Yet when he would sleep supposes he sees many things which he sees not. A mist in his eyes, a giddiness in his head, an inclination to the falling sickness, a thing rising up out of the lower part of his stomach up to his head.<br />

He doubted whether this dream vision &amp; sight of a strange light did signify good or bad.<br />
The dream did so terrify him with melancholy for a day or 2 after that he supposed that he should die about a week after.<br />

			<p>Gryphen Crocker of Little Kymble, 60 year. Saturday 3 December 1603, 9.50 am. His eyesight failed him by little he knows not how. His ground is haunted &amp; treasure is hid there as the report goes. There is heard much music &amp; melody. This Gryphen Crocker has seen lights. The parson of Elsborough 16, 17, 18 years since delivered a note out of a book unto Henry Ginger that now dwells at Wigginton in Hertfordshire, an old man of 80 years. As follows: Elsborough church &amp; Little Kymble church of the right side of the way even against the castle hill there lies of gold &amp; silver &amp; jewels, brass &amp; pewter. A wain load laid in by lord Everet Knotsby &amp; his man at the conquest. This was all that was delivered him in a note, which he lost, willing him to enquire further for he himself saw often a great light which has been seen since by many since his death. &amp; sometimes there will appear a thing like a black hog &amp; very lately seen a white cat with a marvellous long &amp; great tail which ran into a pond. Music heard lately by Crockwell &amp; his wife &amp; children. Henry Ginger within those 2 years when some came to seek this treasure saw a white bullock without ears &amp; horns. &amp; others saw a fair gentlewoman. A lion, an antelope, a friar with a grey cloak cast upon his shoulders. But none could find the treasure.<br />

[Chart.]<br />
Married 3 years to her husband. She is willing to lie with him, but will not permit her husband to have the use of her body. Feels a yucking up of her meat &amp; is as one tormented that she cannot [breaks off]. It will lie in her throat not able to speak her eyes closed &amp; her mouth &amp; yet sometimes will bounce on her bed &amp; yet cannot speak striving, &amp; then it will choke her &amp; then will weep &amp; when they go to prayer the more ease she feels. Is foolish &amp; mopish some days &amp; at other times she will neither. Blood letting or purging will do her good. At some times of the year, a deadness began &amp; a while after will grow frantic. If she take a vomit it will work &amp; she will fall down dead for 3 hours &amp; then afterward will come to her sense. Never now desires carnal copulation.<br />

			<p>Millers, Friday 14 July 1598 7.45 am. Thomas Richardson for his wife. To know what will be her end. About 30 years old. She suspects she has been bewitched. Light headed &amp; talks much of the devil. She can not speak. Sometimes in her fit lets out her excrements.<br />
[Chart.]<br />
It seems she has taken it with a great grief. Her mind much disquieted. She scratched one that she thought had bewitched her. Magnum argumentum est maledicae linguae et hostis odij [The great evidence is of evil speech and the hatred of enemies].<br />
