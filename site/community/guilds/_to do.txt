    add "insert members' list", "insert guild nav" and "guild chat" tags to the page - when rendering the page, then the list of members of this guild is displayed where the tag is, list all the pages for this guild, or the guild chat marker is replaced by a link to open the chat client, but straight to a guild only room
    insert: 
    - member's list
    - guild navigation
    - guild chat
    - guild calendar
    - latest news (+ rss feeds)
    - forum
    - gallery
    - guild mail
    - voting
    - ? awarding/viewing medals & titles
   - who's online
   - quotes box
